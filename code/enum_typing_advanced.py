# The `typing` library provides support for type hints and annotations in Python. This can help catch type errors at compile-time and improve code readability and maintainability. This is similar to the type systems found in statically typed languages such as Rust and Go, as well as functional programming languages such as Idris and Haskell.

# The `enum` library provides a way to define enumerated constants in Python. This can make code more readable and easier to understand, as we can use meaningful names instead of arbitrary values. This is similar to the algebraic data types found in functional programming languages such as Idris and Haskell. Additionally, the use of `enum` can help catch errors at compile-time, as it provides a way to define a closed set of values that a variable can take on.

# Here's an example usage of the `mix_colors` function:

colors = [Color.RED, Color.GREEN, Color.BLUE]

result = mix_colors(colors)

print(result) # Output: (255, 255, 255)

# Here's an example usage of the `calculate` function:

a = 5

b = 2

operator = Operator.ADD

result = calculate(a, b, operator)

print(result) # Output: 7.0
