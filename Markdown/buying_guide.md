# Guide to Buying Cheap, Mid-Range, and Premium Products on a Low Wage in India

For people on a low wage, it can be challenging to decide what products to buy and how much to spend. Here is a guide to help you make that decision:

## Cheap Products

Cheap products can be a great option for those on a low wage, but it is important to avoid buying products that are of such low quality that they will need to be replaced often. Additionally, cheap products may not always provide the necessary features or durability required for everyday use.

**When to buy cheap:**

- For products that will be used infrequently

- For products that are easily replaceable

- For items that do not require a high level of quality or durability

- For items that are not essential

**Where to avoid cheap products:**

- Electronics (especially smartphones and laptops)

- Furniture

- Appliances (such as refrigerators and washing machines)

Examples of cheap products for low wage people:

- Generic brand groceries

- Basic clothing from local shops

- Non-branded kitchen utensils

## Mid-Range Products

Mid-range products offer a balance between price and quality. They are typically a better investment than cheap products but may not offer the same level of features and durability as premium products.

**When to buy mid-range:**

- For products that are used frequently

- For products that require a certain level of quality or durability

- For items that are essential but do not require top-of-the-line features

**Where to avoid mid-range products:**

- High-end clothing or luxury items

- Specialized equipment (such as professional-grade cameras or musical instruments)

- Custom-built furniture or home decor

Examples of mid-range products for low wage people:

- Branded but affordable clothing

- Mid-range smartphones with good features

- Branded kitchen appliances that offer decent quality

## Premium Products

Premium products are typically the most expensive option but offer the highest level of quality and features. They are an investment in quality and durability.

**When to buy premium:**

- For products that will be used frequently and for a long period of time

- For products that require the highest level of quality and durability

- For items that are essential and require top-of-the-line features

**Where to avoid premium products:**

- For products that are easily replaceable or not essential

- For items that are quickly outdated or replaced by newer technology

- For products that require specialized knowledge or training to use effectively

Examples of premium products for low wage people:

- High-end smartphones that offer long-term usage and durability

- High-quality appliances that are energy-efficient and durable

- Branded furniture that provides better comfort and longevity
