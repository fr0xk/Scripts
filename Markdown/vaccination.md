# The Complexity of Vaccination: Examining Risks and Extremes

## Introduction

Vaccination plays a crucial role in safeguarding public health, particularly in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Try to objectively evaluate the potential risks associated with vaccines. This article delves into the historical track record of vaccination, highlights notable risks and mitigations, and explores the polarized views surrounding vaccines. It aims to establish a balanced understanding of the complexities involved and the importance of reliable information sources.

## Historical Track Record

Vaccination has, on rare occasions, been linked to allergic reactions, including, even if at very minor circumstances, the severe and potentially life-threatening condition known as "anaphylaxis." For instance, some individuals may experience anaphylaxis after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. It's another fact that such instances are exceedingly rare and should not overshadow the overall safety profile of vaccines but past experiences with vaccines, such as the oral polio vaccine (OPV), have demonstrated associated risks. The OPV was known to cause cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio. To address this concern, many countries have transitioned to the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which effectively mitigates this specific risk. This example underscores the continuous efforts to enhance vaccine safety.

Additionally, certain vaccines, including the influenza vaccine, have been associated with a slight increase in the risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a neurological disorder characterized by muscle weakness and, in severe cases, paralysis. These instances are rare and need to be evaluated within the broader context of the benefits provided by vaccination.

## Addressing Vaccine Production Risks

Vaccine production itself carries inherent risks, one of which is the potential contamination of the virus if not adequately disposed of. Stringent manufacturing processes and quality control measures are in place to minimize such risks. For example, thorough testing and adherence to strict guidelines are crucial to ensuring the safety and efficacy of vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccine development process serves as a pertinent example of the extensive scrutiny and rigorous evaluation undertaken to bring vaccines to the market safely and swiftly.

## The Extremes: Pro-Vaxxers vs. Anti-Vaxxers

Within the vaccination discourse, extreme viewpoints can emerge from both pro-vaccine advocates and anti-vaccine skeptics. Relying solely on information from either of these extremes lead to misinformation or an incomplete understanding of the subject matter. Pro-vaccine advocates percieve blindly trusting the science presented through mainstream media or the internet without fully comprehending the rigorous scientific methods and verification processes employed by genuine scientists. On the other hand, anti-vaccine skeptics dismiss or discredit scientific research, often citing anecdotal evidence or unreliable sources. I personally suggest to approach the subject with an open mind.

### COVID-19 Death Rate Report

This report provides some statistics on COVID-19 death rate by age, gender and comorbidity globally, as of August 9, 2023.

**Death Rate by Age, Gender and Comorbidity**

The COVID-19 death rate varies significantly by age group, with older people being more vulnerable to severe outcomes. According to a study based on 72,314 cases in China, the death rate was highest among those aged 80 and above (**14.8%**), followed by those aged 70-79 (**8.0%**) and 60-69 (**3.6%**). The death rate was lowest among children and young adults aged 0-29 (**0.2%** or less)¹.

The COVID-19 death rate also differs by gender, with males being more likely to die than females. According to the same study in China, the death rate was **2.8%** for males and **1.7%** for females¹. A similar pattern was observed in other countries, such as the US, where the age-adjusted death rate was **76.3** per 100,000 for males and **49.8** per 100,000 for females in 2022².

The presence of comorbidities or underlying conditions also increases the risk of death from COVID-19. According to data from New York City, as of May 13, 2020, **75%** of the deaths were among people with at least one underlying condition, such as diabetes, lung disease, cancer, immunodeficiency, heart disease, hypertension, asthma, kidney disease, or GI/liver disease. A global study based on 3.5 million cases estimated that the death rate was highest among those with cardiovascular disease (**13.2%**), followed by diabetes (**9.2%**) and chronic respiratory disease (**8.0%**).

## "Trust the science (experts*)" movement

Science has big issues nowadays. Blindly trusting all science has problems. Peer-reviewed science is the best we've got, but it's not perfect. How we put it into action has lots of problems we can't ignore. In many research areas, there are strong biases and politics. It's tough to get funding or move forward when your ideas go against the norm. Science is about challenging ideas, but that doesn't always happen. Advocacy research is common, where funding aims to prove a specific point, especially in business. Think about a company funding research to prove their product is the best, rather than seeking unbiased truth. This kind of advocacy research happens a lot in business because the goal is often to boost sales and not necessarily discover objective truths.

Reproducibility is a big problem, especially in social sciences. Most people find it challenging to understand the complex language and methods used. This gap in comprehension exists because scientific research is often communicated in a way that's inaccessible to the average person. About half of the published research can't be replicated. This is a major issue because valid conclusions should be reproducible. Consider a study claiming something significant, but when other researchers try to replicate it, they can't. This lack of reproducibility happens due to various factors, including methodological differences, making it hard to trust the original findings.

Most scientific research doesn't have practical use for regular people. Understanding published papers, methods, and assumptions is hard. Grasping complex modeling and statistical analyses is a challenge. This won't change because it needs a deep level of knowledge. Consider someone experiencing a tough emotional situation, like a breakup. While science can explain the surge of certain hormones influencing emotions, it doesn't directly offer practical advice on how to cope or move forward. The gap here lies in the fact that scientific knowledge about hormones doesn't always translate into immediate, actionable guidance for individuals dealing with the complexities of real-life emotional challenges.

Unlike the complexities of scientific analysis, everyday life requires dealing with emotions and crises. Science doesn't help much here. It might give some insight into hormones, but what people really need is understanding what truly matters and finding solutions.

## Seeking Reliable Information

To navigate the complexities of vaccination, it is vital to rely on credible sources of information. Both mainstream media and fringe sources may present biased or censored viewpoints, making it imperative to access trustworthy and verified resources. Independent verification and cross-referencing of scientific research are vital for obtaining accurate and comprehensive knowledge.

Ultimately, unless individuals possess the necessary expertise and resources to conduct independent tests and research, approach the subject with caution and skepticism. Only by relying on reliable information and embracing critical thinking, we can form well-informed perspectives.

## Conclusion

Vaccination has a remarkable track record of contributing to public health by preventing and controlling infectious diseases. Try to acknowledge and address the potential risks associated with vaccines. By considering historical instances, mitigating measures,and recognizing the complexity of vaccine production, we can foster a balanced understanding of the subject.

The extreme viewpoints held by pro-vaccine advocates and anti-vaccine skeptics only hinder productive discussions and lead to misinformation and conflicts, no solution whatsoever.
