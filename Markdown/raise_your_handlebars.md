## Why You Should Raise Your Handlebars and Stop Torturing Yourself

If you're like most cyclists, you probably think that lowering your handlebars and bending your back like a pretzel will make you faster and more aerodynamic. You might even spend hundreds of dollars on fancy carbon fiber stems, bars, and saddles to achieve that perfect racing position. But guess what? You're wrong. And you're hurting yourself. You see, the racing culture has brainwashed us into believing that we need to suffer and sacrifice comfort for speed. But why? What's the point? It's not like you're going to win the Tour de France. And even if you do, is it worth risking your health and happiness for? The truth is, lowering your handlebars and hunching over your bike does not make you significantly faster. In fact, it can make you slower and less efficient. How? By reducing your breathing capacity, restricting your blood flow, increasing your muscle fatigue, and impairing your balance and handling. Not to mention, it can cause chronic pain and injuries to your neck, back, shoulders, wrists, and knees.

Don't believe me? Here are some facts to back me up:

- According to a study by the University of Colorado, lowering your handlebars by 10 cm only reduces your drag by 2.5%, which translates to a mere 0.5 km/h increase in speed at 40 km/h. That's hardly worth the discomfort and risk of injury. 
- Another study by the University of Portsmouth found that cyclists who adopted a more upright posture had better lung function and oxygen uptake than those who leaned forward. The researchers concluded that "a more upright riding posture may be advantageous during submaximal cycling as it allows greater pulmonary volumes and gas exchange."
- A third study by the University of Southern Denmark showed that cyclists who raised their handlebars by 4 cm improved their performance by 8.5% on a 30-minute time trial. The reason? They reduced their muscle activation and oxygen consumption, which allowed them to pedal more efficiently and comfortably.

So, what's the alternative? Simple: raise your handlebars and adjust your stem to a comfortable height and angle. This will allow you to sit more upright and relaxed, which will improve your breathing, blood circulation, muscle function, and bike control. You'll also enjoy the ride more, as you'll be able to see the scenery better and avoid neck and back pain. Don't worry about looking uncool or unprofessional. You're not a racer, you're a rider. And riding is supposed to be fun and enjoyable, not a competition to see who can suffer the most. So, do yourself a favor and raise your handlebars. Your body and mind will thank you.
