## Hints:

Here are the solutions for the questions:

- **Chapter 1 - Electric Charges and Fields**
    - The third charge q3 can be placed at the midpoint of the line joining q1 and q2 such that it experiences no net force. This is because the electric fields due to q1 and q2 at the midpoint are equal and opposite in direction.
    - The electric field at a point P inside the shell is zero. This is because the electric flux through any closed surface inside the shell is zero by Gauss's law. The electric field at a point Q outside the shell is given by E = kQ/R^2, where k is the Coulomb's constant. This is because the shell behaves as a point charge Q placed at its centre.
    - The torque acting on the dipole is given by τ = p × E, where p is the dipole moment and E is the electric field. The potential energy of the dipole is given by U = -p.E, where . denotes the scalar product.

- **Chapter 2 - Electrostatic Potential and Capacitance**
    - When the capacitors are connected in parallel, the charge on each capacitor remains constant but the potential difference across them becomes equal. Let V' be the final potential difference. Then, by conservation of charge, we have Q = CV' + 2CV'. Solving for V', we get V' = V/3. The heat dissipated in the process is given by H = (Q^2/2C)(1 - 1/9) = (4/9)(Q^2/2C).
    - The electric potential at any point inside a spherical conductor is equal to the potential at its surface. Therefore, the potential at the centre of the cavity is V = kQ/R, where k is the Coulomb's constant.
    - When the dielectric slab is inserted, the capacitance of the capacitor increases by a factor of K. The charge on the capacitor remains constant but the potential difference across it decreases by a factor of K. Therefore, the initial energy stored in the capacitor is U i = Q^2/2C and the final energy stored in the capacitor is U f = Q^2/2KC. The change in energy stored in the capacitor is ΔU = U i - U f = (K-1)Q^2/2KC.

- **Chapter 3 - Current Electricity**
    - When the wire is stretched to double its length, its area of cross-section becomes half. Therefore, its new resistance R' is given by R' = ρ(2L)/(A/2) = 4ρL/A = 4R, where ρ is the resistivity of the material. The resistivity of the material does not change as it depends only on temperature and nature of material.
    - The current in the circuit is given by I = E/(R+r), where E is the emf of cell and r is its internal resistance. The terminal voltage of cell is given by V = IR = E - Ir.
    - The potential gradient along the potentiometer wire is given by k = E/(R+r), where E is the emf of cell, R is external resistance and r is resistance per unit length of wire. The balancing length for source of emf 10 mV is given by l = ε/k, where ε is emf of source. Substituting values, we get l = (10×10^-3)/(2/(5+R)). Solving for R, we get R = 0.5 ohm.

- **Chapter 4 - Moving Charges and Magnetism**
    - The magnetic moment of coil is given by M = NIA, where N is number of turns, I is current and A is area of coil. The torque acting on coil is given by τ = M × B, where B is magnetic field.
    - The magnetic force acting on proton is given by F = qvB sinθ, where q is charge of proton, v is its speed, B is magnetic field and θ is angle between v and B. Since v and B are parallel, θ = 0° or 180° . Therefore, F = 0.
    - To convert a galvanometer into an ammeter of range 0-10 A, a shunt resistance S must be connected in parallel with it such that I g G = I sh S , where I
