# A matter of contemplation

I somehow strongly feel the growing unease within me, sensing an impending global conflict fueled by nationalism, propaganda, and suppression. The echoes of history haunt me – people yearning for a liberator, animosity, indifference, and a complex international debt system. These precursors have led to devastating consequences before, and they terrify me. I desperately hope to avoid another war; the mere thought of it shatters me, especially knowing many close to me could end up on the frontline. In recent times, people are increasingly behaving like tribals, aligning themselves with specific groups or belief systems. People always acted as tribals before but I feel it's more open and encouraged now than ever. The world is now perceived as an "us vs. them" battleground more than ever before, particularly among young adults who encounter one-sided information that promotes certain ideologies. Notably, extreme religious fundamentalism, such as Hindutva (which advocates Hindu nationalism), Jalacha, Hadiths & Shariah, Neo Nazism etc have found their way into young minds personalities and social media content. Surprisingly, at the same time there's a rise in shameless and aggressive debates around gender supremacy and its fluidity. Instead of pursuing objective and quantifiable knowledge in fields like mathematics, science, engineering, medicine or sociology, today's youth seem more preoccupied with matters of religion, romance, marriage, parenting, violence, pseudo-science and social power dynamics. This level of influence on the youth is both novel and concerning.

As I contemplate the state of the world, I can’t escape the realization that political polarization is intensifying globally, spanning the last century. Populism, nationalism, extremism, a cost-of-living crisis, and the looming threat of climate change contribute to a troubling scenario. It’s disheartening to acknowledge that we, as a species, may be the architects of our own predicament, with anthropocentrism often used to justify the exploitations we inflict upon the world. I hope I'm just being paranoid here, I really hope that.
