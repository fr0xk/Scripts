# A matter of contemplation

I somehow strongly feel the growing unease within me, sensing an impending global conflict fueled by nationalism, propaganda, and suppression. The echoes of history haunt me – people yearning for a liberator, animosity, indifference, and a complex international debt system. These precursors have led to devastating consequences before, and they terrify me. I desperately hope to avoid another war; the mere thought of it shatters me, especially knowing many close to me could end up on the frontline.

As I contemplate the state of the world, I can’t escape the realization that political polarization is intensifying globally, spanning the last century. Populism, nationalism, extremism, a cost-of-living crisis, and the looming threat of climate change contribute to a troubling scenario. It’s disheartening to acknowledge that we, as a species, may be the architects of our own predicament, with anthropocentrism often used to justify the exploitations we inflict upon the world. I hope I'm just being paranoid here, I really hope that.
