India's history is replete with significant achievements and profound struggles, marked by the rise and fall of empires, relentless conflicts, and oppressive colonial rule.

- Prehistoric Period (2 million BCE - 10,000 BCE): The earliest signs of human life on the Indian subcontinent indicate a harsh, survival-driven existence.

- Indus Valley Civilization (3300 BCE - 1300 BCE): This early civilization developed sophisticated urban centers like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, which mysteriously collapsed, possibly due to environmental changes or invasions. The Indus Valley Civilization, which lasted from 3300 BCE to around 1500-1700 BCE, did develop sophisticated urban centers. As for its collapse, there are a few theories. One suggests an invasion by a nomadic Indo-European tribe called the Aryans. However, this idea has been contradicted by more recent evidence. Climate change, specifically drought due to the drying of the Saraswati River, is now considered the most likely cause. This environmental change likely led to crop failures, starvation, and disease, causing people to migrate and establish smaller settlements.

- Vedic Period (1500 BCE - 500 BCE): The composition of the Vedas during this period introduced the Varna system, organizing society into hierarchical groups that later solidified into rigid social structures. A shift from the Indo-European people settling in the Indian subcontinent around 1500 BCE

- Mahajanapadas (600 BCE - 300 BCE): During the Mahajanapadas period in ancient India, Licchavis of Vaishali and the Mallas of Kusinara were governed by assemblies of citizens, making them early examples of democratic governance. Sixteen fragmented kingdoms—Anga, Assaka, Avanti, Chedi, Gandhara, Kamboja, Kashi, Kosala, Kuru, Magadha, Malla, Matsya, Panchala, Shurasena, Vajji, and Vatsa—were often embroiled in conflict, undermining stability and causing frequent warfare.

- Mauryan Empire (322 BCE - 185 BCE): Despite reaching heights under Chandragupta and Ashoka, this empire was built on violent conquests. Ashoka’s conversion to Buddhism, prompted by the horrors of war, led to its widespread promotion across his realm.

- Gupta Empire (320 CE - 550 CE): Known for cultural and intellectual achievements, this empire also suffered from internal corruption and invasions, leading to its eventual decline. They practiced a form of dentistry that included using rudimentary drills for tooth extraction, often resulting in considerable pain for patients. They also had a complex caste system, with the lower castes facing severe discrimination and limited opportunities for social mobility. The rigid caste system in India dawned in the Gupta period that witnessed imposition of new social norms including restriction on marriage, Indian scientists have claimed through an exhaustive genetic study

- Medieval Period (600-18th century CE): Marked by invasions and the rise of various dynasties, this period saw significant destruction and population displacement. One shocking fact is that medieval India saw the widespread practice of Sati, where widows were expected to immolate themselves on their husband's funeral pyre.

- Colonial Era (18th-20th century CE): European colonization, particularly by the British, imposed new levels of economic exploitation, cultural suppression, and systemic racism. The British dismantled traditional industries, leading to massive unemployment and dependency on British imports. Agriculturally, they prioritized cash crops for export over subsistence farming, contributing to severe famines, notably the Bengal Famine of 1943, which resulted in millions of deaths. Administrative policies and land taxes were designed to benefit British economic interests at the expense of local welfare, exacerbating poverty and distress.

- Modern India (1947-present): Since independence, India has confronted political turmoil, corruption, poverty, and social unrest, alongside economic development and technological advancement. India has one of the highest rates of open defecation in the world, with millions lacking access to proper sanitation facilities.

This view highlights a history shaped by recurring cycles of conflict, exploitation, and upheaval, alongside cultural richness and resilience.
