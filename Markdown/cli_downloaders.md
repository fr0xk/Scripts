To configure aria2, curl, and wget for maximum resumable download speed, you can adjust various settings to enable multiple connections, resume capabilities, and optimize the bandwidth usage. Hereâ€™s how to configure each tool:

### aria2 Configuration

1. **Increase Number of Connections**:
   Increase the number of connections to the server.
   ```sh
   aria2c -s 16 -x 16 --max-concurrent-downloads=5 --split=16 --max-connection-per-server=16 https://example.com/file.zip
   ```
   - `-s 16`: Split the download into 16 segments.
   - `-x 16`: Use 16 connections per server.
   - `--max-concurrent-downloads=5`: Allow 5 concurrent downloads.
   - `--split=16`: Split the download into 16 parts.
   - `--max-connection-per-server=16`: Maximum connections per server.

2. **Enable Resuming Downloads**:
   ```sh
   aria2c -c https://example.com/file.zip
   ```
   - `-c`: Continue from the last session.

3. **Set Maximum Download Limit**:
   ```sh
   aria2c --max-download-limit=0 https://example.com/file.zip
   ```
   - `--max-download-limit=0`: No limit on download speed.

4. **Sample Command with All Options**:
   ```sh
   aria2c -c -s 16 -x 16 --max-concurrent-downloads=5 --split=16 --max-connection-per-server=16 --max-download-limit=0 https://example.com/file.zip
   ```

### curl Configuration

1. **Enable Resuming Downloads**:
   ```sh
   curl -C - -O https://example.com/file.zip
   ```
   - `-C -`: Continue from the last session.
   - `-O`: Save the file with the same name as the remote file.

2. **Multiple Connections**:
   Unfortunately, `curl` does not support multiple connections natively for a single file. However, you can script multiple connections manually.

3. **Sample Command**:
   ```sh
   curl -C - -O https://example.com/file.zip
   ```

### wget Configuration

1. **Enable Resuming Downloads**:
   ```sh
   wget -c https://example.com/file.zip
   ```
   - `-c`: Continue from the last session.

2. **Increase Number of Connections**:
   Use the `--max-threads` option for GNU Wget 1.21 or newer, or use wget2 for parallel downloads.
   ```sh
   wget2 -c -N -t 0 -T 10 -P /path/to/save --max-threads=16 https://example.com/file.zip
   ```
   - `-N`: Turn on timestamping.
   - `-t 0`: Set number of retries to infinite.
   - `-T 10`: Set timeout to 10 seconds.
   - `-P /path/to/save`: Set download directory.
   - `--max-threads=16`: Use 16 threads for download.

3. **Sample Command**:
   ```sh
   wget -c -N -t 0 -T 10 -P /path/to/save https://example.com/file.zip
   ```

## To download a torrent using aria2 with the fastest speed, resume support, and no seeding, you can use the following steps:

1. **Install aria2**:
   Make sure you have aria2 installed. You can install it using your package manager. For example:
   - On Ubuntu/Debian:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install aria2
     ```
   - On macOS (using Homebrew):
     ```bash
     brew install aria2
     ```
   - On Windows, you can download the installer from the official [aria2 releases page](https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases).

2. **Create an aria2 configuration file**:
   You can customize aria2's behavior using a configuration file. Create a file named `aria2.conf` with the following content:

   ```plaintext
   # Basic Configuration
   continue=true
   max-concurrent-downloads=5
   split=10
   min-split-size=1M
   file-allocation=falloc

   # No Seeding
   seed-time=0

   # Connection Configuration
   max-connection-per-server=16
   enable-http-pipelining=true
   ```

   Save this file in a convenient location.

3. **Download the torrent**:
   Use the following command to download the torrent. Replace `example.torrent` with the path to your torrent file and `/path/to/download/` with your desired download location.

   ```bash
   aria2c --conf-path=/path/to/aria2.conf -d /path/to/download/ example.torrent
   ```

   Here's a breakdown of the command:
   - `--conf-path=/path/to/aria2.conf`: Specifies the configuration file to use.
   - `-d /path/to/download/`: Specifies the directory where the files will be downloaded.
   - `example.torrent`: The path to your torrent file.

### Additional Tips:

- **Magnet Links**: If you're using a magnet link instead of a torrent file, simply replace `example.torrent` with the magnet link in the command.
  ```bash
  aria2c --conf-path=/path/to/aria2.conf -d /path/to/download/ "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:..."
  ```

- **Resume Downloads**: aria2 supports resuming downloads out of the box as long as `continue=true` is set in the configuration.

By following these steps, you will be able to download torrents using aria2 with optimal speed, resume support, and without seeding.

### Summary

- **aria2**: Best for maximum performance with multiple connections and advanced features.
- **curl**: Best for simple downloads and resuming but lacks multiple connection support.
- **wget**: Reliable for resuming and multiple connections (using wget2).

By using these configurations, you can maximize the download speed and ensure resumable downloads for large files.
