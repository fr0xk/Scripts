How we ride depends a lot on the vehicle and how safe we feel in it. For instance, cyclists usually ride cautiously, staying close to the curb and avoiding busy areas because they don't feel very safe. They can also add to the traffic challenges. They stick to the edges and steer clear of packed spots to stay safe, but sometimes they move unpredictably, which messes with traffic flow. Their cautious moves can sometimes annoy other drivers.

On the flip side, people in cars feel more secure and drive with more confidence, even in heavy traffic. These behaviors vary widely depending on the vehicle and driver, making road risks complicated and hard to predict. When we think about safety, we often think of minor crashes like bumping into another car, but real-life accidents are different. Most deadly crashes happen at high speeds or involve reckless driving or distractions.

It's not simple to think about vehicle safety. It's not just about how safe a car is by itself; it's about how traffic works. Stats and numbers make sense when things are predictable, but traffic is more like a crazy stock market. The more it seems controlled, the more chaos can mess things up. In cities, with all their intersections and stop-and-go traffic, it's like organized chaos. A little problem, like a car breaking down, can cause big traffic jams or crashes. In rural areas, traffic is less predictable, but sudden things like a deer on the road can cause huge issues because they're unexpected. Both cases show that even if traffic seems orderly, chaos and risk are always there. Cyclists stay close to the curb and avoid busy spots because they feel vulnerable, although sometimes they take risks to get around obstacles. Car drivers often feel safe and drive confidently, but that can mean they drive aggressively or carefully, thinking about the danger they could cause.

Risk isn't straightforward. Many people think bigger cars are safer, but that's not always true. There's also a reflexive effectâ€”if people think cars are safer, more people get them and drive them, which can make them less safe.
