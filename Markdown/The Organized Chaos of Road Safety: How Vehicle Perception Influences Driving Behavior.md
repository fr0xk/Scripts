Our perception of safety influences how we behave on the road. Cyclists, feeling vulnerable, tend to ride cautiously near curbs and avoid busy areas. This caution sometimes leads to unpredictable maneuvers that disrupt traffic flow. Drivers, on the other hand feel more secure in cars, leading to a more confident driving style, even in heavy traffic.

Traffic safety is complex and not simply a matter of individual vehicle safety. It's about how different vehicles interact within a system. Predictable behavior is key for safety, but real-world traffic is far less predictable. In cities, seemingly organized traffic with stop signs and intersections are disrupted by minor events like a car breakdown, stall causing delays or accidents. In rural areas, with less traffic congestion, an unexpected event like wild cat crossing street can cause serious accidents due to their unpredictable nature.

Regardless of the setting, both cyclists and drivers navigate inherent risks. Cyclists, despite their cautious riding style, sometimes take risks to avoid obstacles, waves in and out, violates traffic norms. Drivers, feeling a false sense of security, and drive aggressively or inattentively. The misconception that bigger cars are inherently safer still persists even this era. There's also reflexivity in play - rise in car ownership due to this perception ironically leads to less safety on the road due to increased cars on roads.
