Safety, in our perspective determines how one conducts himself on the roads. A common notion that the cyclist feels exposed and therefore pedals close to the sidewalk and or; areas with low traffic. Such a caution sometimes results in unexpected and reckless driving maneuvers which turn out to affect traffic patterns. Drivers on the other hand, are safer when they are inside cars, hence; they have a free and confident style of driving even in congested traffic.

Transport safety is a multifaceted issue that can hardly be solved by focusing only on the safety of individual vehicles. It is about how various entities of a system work or exist in relation to one another with reference to vehicle. This is excellent information as predictable behavior is great for safety especially when the car is learning and there are many cars on the road which are not predictable at all. Organized traffic in city environments that appear to follow traffic signs such as stop signs, traffic lights, and road junctions are confounded by small incidents such as car failure, stalling, or resulting in minor traffic delays and accidents. This is perhaps because in rural areas which are less likely to experience traffic build up, an event like a wild cat crossing the street can provoke a traumatic incident due to their unpredictability.

Cyclists as well as drivers, in any setting, operate under self-impending dangers. Cyclists though they are very careful while cycling still they have often have to maneuver to avoid the obstacles, cycles which are weaving in and out, violate usual traffic standards. Drivers, for instance, realize that there were unusual security precautions in their vehicle and drive erratically or unconsciously. The fact that large car are safer still prevails even in this era of automobile manufacturing. There is also reciprocal causality at work here â€“ this perception leads to an increase in car ownership and consequently there is decreased safety on the road due to the congestion from the many cars.
