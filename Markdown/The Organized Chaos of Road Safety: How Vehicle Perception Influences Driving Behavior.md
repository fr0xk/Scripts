How we ride depends a lot on the vehicle and how safe we feel in it. For example, cyclists usually ride cautiously, sticking close to the curb and avoiding busy areas because they don’t feel very safe. On the other hand, people in cars feel more secure and drive more confidently, even in heavy traffic. These behaviors vary a lot across different vehicles and drivers, making the risk on the road complex and unpredictable.

When we think about safety, we often picture crash tests, like minor fender benders. But real-life accidents are different. Most deadly crashes happen at high speeds, involve reckless driving, or are due to distractions.

Thinking about vehicle safety in a simple way doesn’t work. A vehicle isn’t just dangerous or safe on its own; it’s about the chaos of traffic. Statistics and probabilities make sense in controlled environments where everything is predictable. But traffic is like the stock market—organized chaos. The more it seems organized, the bigger the impact of any chaos. Think about traffic in a busy city versus a rural area. In a city, the dense traffic, many intersections, and constant stop-and-go make it a highly organized yet chaotic environment. A minor disruption, like a stalled car, can cause major traffic jams or accidents. In rural areas, traffic is less organized, but sudden events like a deer crossing the road can cause big problems because they’re unexpected. Both situations show how even orderly traffic doesn’t reduce the potential for chaos and risk. Cyclists stick close to the curb and avoid busy areas because they feel vulnerable, though sometimes they take risks to get around obstacles. Car drivers often feel safe and drive confidently, but that means they also drive aggressively in traffic but they might also drive carefully thinking about potential danger they can pose.

Risk is non-linear. But most people approach like it's some kind of "bigger is safer" approach. There's also reflexive effect. If cars are perceived as safer, more people buying cars and driving them on road makes cars less safe than it was & so on.
