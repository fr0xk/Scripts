# Non-Dividend Paying Companies: Deceptive Promises and Speculative Ventures

*By fr0xk*

I find it perplexing how non-dividend paying companies manage to deceive investors with their hollow promises of future dividends, which may never materialize. These companies demand genuine financial investments while offering mere hypothetical returns. They resemble multi-level marketing schemes or collectibles, relying on a continuous influx of new gullible investors to artificially inflate their stock prices, all the while lacking solid fundamentals or any tangible connection between investors and the company. It's akin to one fool selling poker chips to another.

## The Illusion of Growth and Innovation

Some of the largest and most renowned companies in the world, such as Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (META) formerly known as Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), Biogen (BIIB), and Tesla (TSLA), fall into the category of non-dividend paying companies. Despite amassing billions of dollars in revenue and profit, these companies have steadfastly refused to distribute dividends to their shareholders. Their rationale? Reinvesting earnings into growth and innovationâ€”or so they claim.

BUT...!!! what purpose does growth and innovation serve if it fails to translate into tangible returns for the company's owners? Shareholders are the ones who provide the capital necessary for these companies to operate and expand. They rightly deserve a fair portion of the rewards. Otherwise, investors are merely pouring real money into an illusory future cash flow. After all, isn't it all a positive-sum game?

## Zero-Sum Game and Self-Interest

Contrary to popular belief, non-dividend paying companies do not create a positive-sum environment. Instead, they operate within a zero-sum or even negative-sum framework. They prioritize their own value creation at the expense of their shareholders. Inflated stock prices become their currency for acquiring other companies, compensating their top executives excessively, and rewarding employees with stock options. Furthermore, these companies exploit their market dominance and wield their influence to stifle competition and manipulate public opinion, effectively acting as monopolies that harm both customers and society.

## Risks and Volatility

Additionally, non-dividend paying companies pose significant risks and exhibit volatility. They remain at the mercy of market whims and analysts' expectations. Any negative news, failure to meet targets, or even a shift in sentiment can result in a drastic plummet in their stock prices. When this occurs, shareholders are left without any cushion, safety net, or income stream to protect their investments. They are left holding the bag while insiders seize the opportunity to cash out and move on to their next scheme.

## Speculative Ventures, Not Investments

I think non-dividend paying companies should not be considered investments but rather speculative ventures. They involve gambling with other people's money, lacking sustainability and ethical principles.

To echo the words of the esteemed John Burr Williams, *"Earnings are only a means to an end, and the means should not be mistaken for the end. Therefore, we must say that a stock derives its value from its dividends, not its earnings."* This quote encapsulates the importance of dividends as the true indicators of a stock's worth.
