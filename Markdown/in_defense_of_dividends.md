# The Case for Investing in Businesses with Real Cash Flow

Tax evasion, reinvested earnings, stock repurchases, and hypothetical cash flows are all aspects of modern finance that have garnered attention and sparked debates among investors. In this article, we will delve into these topics and argue in favor of investing in businesses that generate and share real cash in the present, as opposed to relying on uncertain projections and hypothetical scenarios. 

## The Illegality of Tax Evasion

First and foremost, it is crucial to recognize that tax evasion is illegal. While some individuals may attempt to defer payment or engage in questionable practices, it is important to understand that liabilities must eventually be settled. Governments have the authority to impose penalties and strict measures to ensure that taxes are paid. Moreover, when taxes are not properly collected, authorities may resort to measures such as printing money, which can lead to rampant inflation and negatively impact individuals and businesses alike. It is evident that tax evasion is not a sustainable or ethical approach to financial management.

## Reinvested Earnings and Shareholder Concerns

Companies that choose to retain earnings often do so with the intention of reinvesting the profits into further growth opportunities. While this strategy may benefit the company in terms of expansion, it can leave shareholders without immediate dividends. In this scenario, shareholders can only realize gains by selling their shares to other investors at higher prices than their initial purchase. This mechanism may give the impression of a Ponzi scheme, as it relies on the continuous influx of new investors to sustain the value of the shares. The lack of direct monetary connection between shareholders and investors raises questions about the true ownership rights and the viability of long-term returns for shareholders.

## Stock Repurchases and Their Implications

Some argue that companies repurchase shares to enhance earnings per share (EPS) and increase the ownership stake of existing shareholders. While this may be true, the question arises as to the purpose of owning a company that does not provide cash flow to its owners due to continuous growth aspirations. The hope of future dividends becomes a distant prospect, and the relationship between investors and shareholders becomes increasingly hypothetical. The proliferation of stock issuance and capital raising without a clear obligation to repay further blurs the line between ownership rights and mere speculation. 

## The Significance of Real Cash in Finance

In the world of finance, various models and methodologies are employed to evaluate investments. One such model is the discounted cash flow (DCF) model, which seeks to assess the present value of future cash flows. While this model has its merits, it is essential to recognize that tangible cash holds greater importance in the realm of practicality. Businesses operate on real money, backed by central banks and subject to legitimate financial transactions. Non-dividend stocks, despite having legal rights, lack the legitimacy and tangible benefits associated with cash flow.

## The Need for Investing in Businesses with Real Cash Flow

Given the uncertainties surrounding hypothetical scenarios and speculative promises, it is prudent for investors to focus on businesses that generate and share real cash in the present. The allure of potential future dividends should not overshadow the importance of tangible returns and immediate cash flow. Investment decisions should be rooted in realistic assessments and the understanding that hypothetical situations can be subject to varying interpretations. It is crucial to consider the legitimacy and stability of a business's financial operations, as well as its ability to provide tangible returns to its shareholders.

In conclusion, the realm of finance is rife with debates and discussions surrounding tax evasion, reinvested earnings, stock repurchases, and hypothetical cash flows. However, by prioritizing investments in businesses that generate and share real cash in the present, investors can navigate the uncertainties of the market and ensure a more solid foundation for long-term financial growth. The focus on tangible returns and realistic assessments empowers investors to make informed decisions based on the actual performance and financials of this company
