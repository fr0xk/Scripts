# Lifestyle:

- Wake up early in the morning around 5-6 am and start the day with some light exercise or yoga. You can follow a simple routine of stretches, sun salutations, and breathing exercises. There are many free online resources available to learn yoga.

- Get ready and have a simple breakfast, such as a bowl of porridge made with oats, milk, and fruit. You can also have tea and biscuits or a slice of bread with butter and jam.

- Leave for work and work until the afternoon. Take a break in between to eat a packed lunch from home, such as roti or rice with dal and vegetables. You can also buy affordable meals from nearby food stalls that serve thali or simple meals.

- After work, return home and rest for some time. For evening leisure activities, you can attend free community events such as music or dance performances, join a local sports club or hobby group, or visit public parks and gardens.
