# Enterprise Value to Revenue Ratios of Indian Sectors

Enterprise value to revenue (EV/Revenue) is a financial ratio that measures how much a company is worth relative to its sales. It is often used to compare the valuation of companies across different industries or markets.

In this article, we will look at the median EV/Revenue ratios of various Indian sectors as on June 18, 2023, based on the data provided by the user. We will also calculate the average and median EV/Revenue of all industries and discuss what they imply. All these companies have minimum sales and MarketCap around 1 billion (100 crores).

## Data

The following table shows the EV/Revenue ratios of different Indian sectors as on June 18, 2023:

| Sector | EV/Revenue |
| --- | --- |
| Consumer Discretionary | 1.5x |
| Communication Services | 2x |
| Consumer Staples | 2x |
| Energy | 1.5x |
| Financials | 4x |
| Healthcare | 3x |
| Industrials | 2x |
| Technology | 2x |
| Materials | 1x |
| Real Estate | 4x |
| Utilities | 2x |

## Analysis

The average EV/Revenue of all industries is **2.27x**, which means that the average company in India is valued at 2.27 times its sales.

The median EV/Revenue of all industries is **2x**, which means that half of the companies in India have a higher valuation than 2 times their sales and half have a lower valuation.

The highest EV/Revenue ratios are observed in the **Financials** and **Real Estate** sectors, which have a ratio of **4x** each. This indicates that these sectors are highly valued by the market and have high growth potential or profitability.

The lowest EV/Revenue ratio is observed in the **Materials** sector, which has a ratio of **1x**. This indicates that this sector is undervalued by the market or has low growth potential or profitability.

The other sectors have EV/Revenue ratios ranging from **1.5x** to **3x**, which are close to the average and median values.

## Relationship between profit margins, growth rate, and valuation multiple

We investigate the relationship between the expected return of a firm and its enterprise value to revenue ratio (EV/R) over a 10-year horizon. We use the median profit margin data provided by the user for different EV/R ranges as follows:

- 3% or less for EV/R below 1
- 5% or less for EV/R between 1 and 2
- 6% for EV/R between 2 and 3
- 9% for EV/R between 3 and 5
- 12% for EV/R between 5 and 10
- 17% for EV/R between 10 and 30

We assume that the firm has a constant EV/R, a constant sales growth rate, and a constant profit margin within each range. We also assume that the firm pays no dividends and reinvests all its earnings. Under these assumptions, we derive the following formula for the expected return of the firm:

$$E(R) = \frac{S_0 \times (1 + g)^n \times \overline{P/S} - P_0}{P_0} + D$$

Where:

- $E(R)$ is the expected return on an investment
- $S_0$ is the current sales per share
- $g$ is the expected constant growth rate of sales
- $n$ is the number of years for which we want to forecast
- $\overline{P/S}$ is the long-term average P/S ratio for the sector or industry
- $P_0$ is the current stock price
- $D$ is the dividend yield

Empirical observations indicate that within the range of 1x to 3x EV/Revenue multiples, a growth rate of 10% is widely regarded as a representative benchmark. This domain encompasses a harmonious equilibrium where investors perceive the fundamental value of an enterprise to be commensurate with its revenue generation capabilities. Companies exhibiting revenue growth within this range are typically valued with a sense of stability, acknowledging their ability to sustain moderate expansion.

Expanding our purview, we venture into the realm of 3x to 30x EV/Revenue multiples, where the growth rate becomes more nuanced. Here, a broader spectrum ranging from 10% to 15% emerges as a benchmark that aligns with prevailing market sentiment. In this elevated territory, investors place greater emphasis on potential future growth, necessitating a more robust and sustainable trajectory. Enterprises that demonstrate consistent revenue growth within this interval are perceived as possessing greater intrinsic worth, justifying the relatively higher valuation multiples assigned to them.

## Conclusion

The EV/Revenue ratios of different Indian sectors provide a useful insight into how the market perceives their value and performance. The average and median EV/Revenue of all industries are around 2x, which suggests that the Indian market is moderately valued. However, there are significant variations among different sectors, with some being overvalued and some being undervalued. Investors can use this information to identify opportunities and risks in different sectors and make informed decisions.
