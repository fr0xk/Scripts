# The Never-Ending Circus of Market Debate

*Author: fr0xk*

---

The world of stock market speculation and investing is a never-ending circus of debates and arguments. It's like a virtual battleground where fundamental investors clash with technical investors, value investors square off against momentum investors, and the chaos just keeps on escalating. It's enough to drive any rational person to the brink of madness. Today, I want to take a moment to express my frustrations and delve into the absurdity that plagues these discussions.

Therefore, adhering to Bonini's principle, trading a system with a very low success rate requires considerable discipline and strong money management skills. Refining such systems does not result in superior profits.

By applying Bonini's principle, if numerous delicate components are combined to construct a system, it becomes antifragile, exhibiting the opposite of "Bonini's paradox."

Bonini's paradox (original):

"Any effort to simplify a complex system into a straightforward formula will reduce the system's comprehensibility as it becomes more comprehensive."

However, the challenge lies in the fact that markets are not only complex but also chaotic. In chaotic systems, having more information does not necessarily lead to better outcomes.

The reverse of Bonini's paradox:

"Any attempt to address simple problems using a complex formula will enhance the system's comprehensibility as the system becomes less comprehensive."

Before we dive into the chaos, let's briefly touch upon the "efficient market hypothesis" (EMH). Now, I'm not going to bore you with an in-depth explanation or get lost in the intricacies of this theory, but it's worth mentioning in this context. The EMH suggests that financial markets reflect all available information, making it impossible to consistently outperform the market by exploiting market inefficiencies. While we won't delve deeper into the EMH, keep in mind that the debates I'm about to discuss often disregard this hypothesis in a loose manner.

So, let's venture into the battlefield of futile arguments, where confusion reigns supreme. One would hope that there's at least some level of agreement on basic terms and concepts, but alas, that is not the case. These debates often revolve around ambiguous and subjective definitions, leaving participants more confused than when they started.

Here's a glimpse into the maddening world of financial semantics:

1. **Intrinsic Value vs Future Value**: Is it about the present or the future? Are we valuing based on concrete factors or making speculative guesses?

2. **Overvalue vs Undervalue**: Is it priced too high or too low? Who gets to decide? And can we ever truly reach a consensus?

3. **Bubble vs Cheap**: Are we in an irrational bubble or is it just an undervalued gem waiting to be discovered? The opinions on this matter are as numerous as the stars in the sky.

4. **DCF vs Price to Value**: Discounted cash flow analysis or price-to-value ratios? Which one holds the key to unlocking the secrets of the market? The battle rages on.

5. **High Payout vs Low Payout**: Should we prioritize high dividends or reinvestment? It's a perpetual tug-of-war between income-seeking investors and growth enthusiasts.

6. **Risk vs Volatility**: How do we define risk? Is it all about the ups and downs or are there deeper considerations at play? This debate seems to have no end in sight.

7. **Trend vs Momentum**: Do we follow the trends or chase after momentary flashes of brilliance? The clash between these two schools of thought never ceases.

8. **Value vs Growth**: Should we seek undervalued stocks or focus on companies with high growth potential? The proponents of each approach defend their beliefs with unwavering conviction.

The list goes on and on, encompassing quantitative analysis versus technical analysis, technical analysis versus fundamental analysis, technical analysis versus astrology (yes, astrology!), fundamental analysis versus astrology, astrology versus astronomy, chartists versus technical analysts, price action versus technical indicators, smart money versus dumb money, hedge funds versus high-frequency traders, high-frequency traders versus day trading, day trading versus swing trading, swing trading versus positional trading, positional trading versus investing, investing versus speculation, and speculation versus gambling.

It's a never-ending loop of pointless arguments that lead us down a rabbit hole of frustration. These discussions seem to have no purpose other than to waste everyone's time and perpetuate the chaos. The lack of consensus, the subjective nature of the topics, and the disregard for the efficient market hypothesis create an environment of utter confusion and chaos. It's as if the participants are trapped in a perpetual loop of self-righteousness, each believing that their approach holds the key to financial success.

But let's take a step back and reassess the situation. While healthy debates and differing opinions are essential for progress and innovation, these discussions often devolve into nothing more than ego battles and pointless rhetoric. It's disheartening to witness the sheer waste of intellectual energy and the failure to focus on more productive endeavors. Here's some random intelligent sounding arguments

**Intrinsic Value.**

Once upon a time, in the pre-internet era, financial statements relied on good ol' historical cost—simple and verifiable. But then, along came fair value accounting, promising a more accurate reflection of current economic reality. Sounds great, right? Well, not so fast! Fair value accounting introduced a massive dose of subjectivity into the financial reporting process. take a look at the thrilling saga of Greek bonds. European banks in 2011 faced a conundrum when it came to valuing these bonds. Despite having access to the same market data and being audited by the same accounting firms, they couldn't agree on a fair value. Some wrote them down by 51%, while others settled for a premium of 21%. It's like watching a three-ring circus where everyone is juggling numbers and playing with illusions! If tradable securities weren't enough to make your head spin, try applying fair value principles to intangible assets. Goodwill, patents, earn-out agreements, and research projects—oh my! The fun never ends! Valuing these intangibles consistently is like chasing a ghost through a maze. And just when you think you've grasped the concept, the disclosure requirements swoop in and leave you drowning in a sea of assumptions. Annual reports that seem to grow longer every year. If they included full disclosure of fair value estimates and their underlying assumptions, we'd need an entire library just to house them. If you have insomnia, reading through these reports over late night is perfect cure.



**Stocks will do well because the economy is recovering.**

And so it is! But so what? That doesn’t mean the stock market will keep booming. From 1968 to 1982 the economy grew nearly 300%, but during that time, the stock market went nowhere. In real, after-tax dollars, investors lost money.

The economy has grown by two-thirds since 1999. How’s your stock portfolio done over that period? The Japanese economy has doubled since 1989, but the Nikkei is still down by three quarters. Studies by Elroy Dimson and colleagues at the London Business School found many cases around the world of capitalist economies where investors did poorly for decades even while the economy grew.

Economic growth does not always produce good investment returns. It’s a myth.

**Stocks should earn 9% a year.**

Com on. This reminds me of Michael Jordan. Also, this is the dumbest claim I have ever heard. So dumb that even my dog laughed at this. The returns in real, or constant dollars, were a much more modest 6%. Second, this is just an average. And it’s very misleading. During all those years, as Stern’s data shows, the stock market only beat inflation by a decent margin during two boom periods — from 1949 to 1967 and from 1982 to 1999. Both were followed by vicious bear markets which wiped out the gains. If you missed those two booms, your total gain from U.S. stocks over the other 54 years since 1928 came to a total of mere 7%, after inflation.


**A balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds will always make money.**

This is more nonsense. I don’t want to reinvent the wheel. The elevator summary is that the so-called “foolproof” balanced portfolio of 60% stocks, 40% bonds has failed, massively, at least twice, just in the past 84 years — from 1937 through 1950, and from 1965 through 1982. It can fail again. That’s because there is nothing magical about a “balanced” portfolio of stocks and bonds. As people used to say, nothing is ever foolproof because fools are so damned inventive. A portfolio of bonds and stocks has only worked in the past when either the stocks were undervalued, or the bonds were undervalued, or both. That’s it. Today, it is neither

In the grand scheme of things, the efficient market hypothesis exists for a reason. While it may not be perfect or hold true in every circumstance, it serves as a reminder that markets are influenced by vast amounts of information and countless participants. Attempting to consistently outsmart the collective wisdom of the market is an uphill battle, if not a fool's errand.

Rather than getting entangled in these futile debates, perhaps we should redirect our energies towards more fruitful pursuits. Instead of arguing over subjective definitions and squabbling about which approach reigns supreme, let's focus on understanding the underlying dynamics of the market and developing strategies that align with our individual goals and risk tolerances.

At the end of the day, investing and speculation should be approached with careful consideration and a long-term perspective. It's about making informed decisions based on sound research, risk management, and a clear understanding of our own financial objectives. Let's not lose sight of the bigger picture amidst the noise of these never-ending debates. In the financial markets, there are several similar scenarios where specific and actionable advice is preferable over general statements. Here are a few examples:

1. Risk Management: Instead of merely advising investors to "diversify your portfolio," it is more effective to provide guidance on asset allocation based on individual risk tolerance and investment goals. For instance, recommending a specific percentage allocation to different asset classes like stocks, bonds, and cash based on a person's risk profile.

2. Trading Strategies: Rather than suggesting generic trading tactics like "buy low, sell high," it is more valuable to outline a specific trading strategy with entry and exit points based on technical indicators, chart patterns, or fundamental analysis. For instance, providing a detailed plan that includes specific price levels or key financial metrics to trigger buying or selling decisions.

3. Financial Planning: When offering advice on personal finance and long-term planning, it is more helpful to provide concrete steps tailored to an individual's circumstances. For example, instead of advising someone to "save more money," it is better to suggest practical steps like creating a budget, automating savings, or exploring investment options like retirement accounts.

4. Risk Assessment: Instead of simply stating that "risk exists in investing," it is crucial to help investors assess and manage specific risks. This could involve identifying potential risks associated with a particular investment, such as market volatility, regulatory changes, or company-specific factors, and providing strategies to mitigate those risks. If the largest and smallest physical systems are pear-shaped, it would seem possible that financial processes could also exhibit a similar form. Bonds and loans are great assets till the borrower defaults. Mortgage-backed securities are fine unless real estate goes pear-shaped. Bull markets last longer and have low volatility while bear markets are quicker but often evaporate years of growth from the prior bull market.

In various financial market scenarios, offering specific and actionable advice tailored to individual circumstances and supported by a clear methodology or strategy can significantly enhance its practical value.

In conclusion, the incessant battles between various factions within the stock market community only serve to distract us from what truly matters: making wise investment choices and navigating the markets with prudence. Instead of wasting time and energy on pointless arguments, let's focus on enhancing our understanding, developing robust strategies, and embracing the ever-evolving nature of the financial world. It's time to break free from the cycle of frustration and channel our efforts towards more productive and meaningful endeavors.
