This article provides an explanation of Trend Following, a strategy utilized in financial markets to respond to price movements. Trend Following relies on predetermined rules derived from various market price factors, without attempting to time the market or make discretionary decisions. Instead, it focuses on capturing the intermediate phase of price trends and offers protection against extreme events.

## Introduction

Trend following is a trading strategy that tries to capture long-term price movements in different markets by following the direction of the trend. Trend followers do not try to predict or forecast future prices, but simply follow the current price action and adjust their positions accordingly.

Trend following works because markets tend to move in trends due to various factors, such as economic cycles, geopolitical events, investor psychology, etc. Trend followers can exploit these trends by riding them until they end, and then switching to the opposite direction when a new trend emerges.

Trend following is speculative, but based on empirical evidence and historical data. Trend followers use systematic rules and algorithms to identify and follow trends, and they test their strategies on historical data to ensure robustness and profitability. Trend following has been proven to work across different markets and large time frames, and has delivered consistent returns over long periods of time. But keep in mind, it's not short term trading like 5-15mins bar strategy.

Trend following is not tax efficient and has costs, but the fact that Trend followers do not need to pay for expensive research, analysis, news, or advice, as they only rely on price data and their own rules. Trend followers also do not trade frequently, as they only adjust their positions when the trend changes, which reduces transaction costs and slippage. Trend followers can also diversify their portfolio across different markets and instruments, which reduces risk and volatility.

Some of the evidence of trend following working are:

- The performance of trend following hedge funds and commodity trading advisors (CTAs), who use trend following as their main strategy. These funds have outperformed the market indices and other hedge fund strategies over long periods of time, especially during market crises and extreme events.

- The success stories of legendary trend followers, such as Richard Dennis, John Henry, Ed Seykota, Bill Dunn, etc., who have made fortunes by following trends in various markets.
- The academic research and studies that have confirmed the validity and profitability of trend following strategies across different markets, time frames, and risk levels.


## The Pareto Principle

We often hear comments like trend following doesn’t work. Well, that is actually half the truth. Trend following doesn’t work on a single underlying like a stock or an index. It relies on the law of large numbers to make it work. This is because trend following also fall under the Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule. It states that for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. If we translate this principle to investing, it would mean that 80% of the profits come from only 20% of the trades we make in our portfolio. What this means is that most of the time, we will feel like our trades are not working and we are only making our brokers happy

## Building a Trading System

It's alot like old cigar butt investing style, hence no discretion or prediction is used. From the Trend Following Pioneer "David Herding":

**Answer the following six questions and you have a trend following trading system:**

- What market do you buy or sell at any time?

- How much of a market do you buy or sell at any time?

- When do you buy or sell a market?

- When do you get out of a losing position?

- When do you get out of a winning position?

- Why do you think you'll make money despite of multiple intermediate losses?

You want to be black or white with this. You do not want gray.

## Benefits and Considerations

Trend Following offers several benefits for market participants, including:

- **Profit from Significant Trends**: By identifying and capitalizing on sustained price trends, Trend Following strategies can generate substantial profits.

- **Protection Against Extreme Events**: Trend Following strategies are designed to provide a level of protection against extreme market events such as financial crises or stock market collapses.

- **Systematic and Rule-based Approach**: Trend Following relies on predetermined rules and objective indicators, removing emotional bias and subjectivity from investment decisions.

But please consider the following aspects (risks) when implementing Trend Following strategies:

- **Whipsaw Risk**: Trend Following strategies are vulnerable to whipsaws, which occur when markets experience short-term price reversals. This can result in losses as positions are exited prematurely.

- **Mental Demands**: Trend Following can be mentally demanding, requiring discipline and adherence to predefined rules, even during periods of market volatility or conflicting signals

## Objectivity and Perspective

One challenge that arises when studying different investment strategies, such as Trend Following and value investing, is maintaining objectivity and perspective. Investors with a value-oriented approach may evaluate situations from an ownership perspective, while Trend Followers often analyze investments from a speculative standpoint. It is rare to find individuals who can objectively study and comprehend different strategies from both perspectives while maintaining a neutral viewpoint.
