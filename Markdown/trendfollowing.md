This article provides an explanation of Trend Following, a strategy utilized in financial markets to respond to price movements. Trend Following relies on predetermined rules derived from various market price factors, without attempting to time the market or make discretionary decisions. Instead, it focuses on capturing the intermediate phase of price trends and offers protection against extreme events.

## Introduction

Trend following is a trading strategy that aims to capture long-term price movements in different markets by following the trend's direction. Trend followers do not try to predict or forecast future prices; instead, they simply follow the current price action and adjust their positions accordingly. In the realm of trend following, the approach starkly differs from the traditional technical analysis that is often deemed deceptive. Instead of relying on support and resistance levels and setting predetermined profit targets, trend following operates in a reactive manner. It involves adhering to a predetermined system pattern, one that can be mechanized or programmed, such as a new all-time high (ATH) or a moving average crossover.

Once a position is taken, the initial stop loss is determined by considering a measure of volatility, such as the average true range (ATR). As the price starts moving in a favorable direction, the stop loss is trailed upwards, ensuring that profits are secured as the trend progresses. This reactive approach stands in stark contrast to the predictive nature of traditional technical analysis, offering a distinct methodology in trend following.

Trend following works because markets tend to move in trends due to various factors, such as economic cycles, geopolitical events, and investor psychology. Trend followers can exploit these trends by riding them until they end and then switching to the opposite direction when a new trend emerges. The definition of a trend is subjective, but academic research defines a trend as follows: if the ratio of the present closing price to the closing price of the last n period is above 1, it is called an uptrend; otherwise, it's a downtrend.

Trend following is speculative but based on empirical evidence and historical data. Trend followers use systematic rules and algorithms to identify and follow trends, and they test their strategies on historical data to ensure robustness and profitability. Trend following has been proven to work across different markets and large time frames, delivering consistent returns over long periods of time. However, it is not a ideal short-term trading strategy like a 5-15 minute bar strategy due to large costs associated with high turnover rates.

Trend following is not tax efficient and has costs, but trend followers do not need to pay for expensive research, analysis, news, or advice as they rely only on price data and their own rules. Trend followers also do not trade frequently, adjusting their positions only when the trend changes, which reduces transaction costs and slippage. Additionally, trend followers can diversify their portfolio across different markets and instruments, reducing risk and volatility.

Some evidence of trend following working includes:

- The performance of trend following hedge funds and commodity trading advisors (CTAs) that use trend following as their main strategy. These funds have outperformed market indices and other hedge fund strategies over long periods of time, especially during market crises and extreme events.

- The success stories of legendary trend followers, such as Richard Dennis, John Henry, Ed Seykota, Jerry Parker, Bill Dunn, etc., who have made fortunes by following trends in various markets.

- Academic research and studies that have confirmed the validity and profitability of trend following strategies across different markets, time frames, and risk levels.

## The Pareto Principle

We often hear comments like "trend following doesn't work." Well, that is only half the truth. Trend following doesn't work on a single underlying asset like a stock or an index. It relies on the law of large numbers to make it work. This is because trend following also falls under the Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule. The principle states that for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. If we translate this principle to investing, it means that 80% of the profits come from only 20% of the trades in our portfolio. This implies that most of the time, we will feel like our trades are not working, and we are only making our brokers happy.

## Randomness vs Chaos

In a random system, even if you possess a time machine, attempting to predict outcomes by traveling back in time would be futile due to the inherent time-independence of randomness.

Market movements do not adhere to randomness; instead, they exhibit chaotic behavior. While in a random system, even with complete knowledge and real-time information as the system's creator, it remains impossible to make accurate predictions.

The nature of market movements is characterized by chaos. This implies that there are instances where predictability is evident, and other times when it is not. In chaotic systems, if you possess real-time knowledge of the aggregate orders placed by all market participants and can process this information instantly, it becomes possible to anticipate market movements before the execution of the next billions of orders.

## Building a Trading System

It's a lot like the old cigar butt investing style; hence no discretion or prediction is used. According to the trend following pioneer David Herding, you can build a trend following trading system by answering the following six questions:

- What market do you buy or sell at any time?

- How much of a market do you buy or sell at any time?

- When do you buy or sell a market?

- When do you get out of a losing position?

- When do you get out of a winning position?

- Why do you think you'll make money despite multiple intermediate losses?

You want to be black or white with this. You do not want gray.

## Benefits and Considerations

Trend Following offers several benefits for market participants, including:

- **Profit from Significant Trends**: By identifying and capitalizing on sustained price trends, Trend Following strategies can generate substantial profits.

- **Protection Against Extreme Events**: Trend Following strategies are designed to provide a level of protection against extreme market events such as financial crises or stock market collapses.

- **Systematic and Rule-based Approach**: Trend Following relies on predetermined rules and objective indicators, removing emotional bias and subjectivity from investment decisions.

But please consider the following aspects (risks) when implementing Trend Following strategies:

- **Whipsaw Risk**: Trend Following strategies are vulnerable to whipsaws, which occur when markets experience short-term price reversals. This can result in losses as positions are exited prematurely.

- **Mental Demands**: Trend Following can be mentally demanding, requiring discipline and adherence to predefined rules, even during periods of market volatility or conflicting signals.

## Psychological Demand

Trend Following systems are not for the faint of heart, as they usually have a low success rate of around 30-40%. To illustrate how challenging it can be, we can use logarithms to calculate how many consecutive losses we can expect in 100 trades. Using the formula logₐ(b) = logₐ(c) / logₐ(d), we can calculate the logarithm of 100 divided by the logarithm of (1-0.35) as follows:

logₐ(100) / logₐ(1-0.35) = logₐ(10²) / logₐ(0.65)

= 2 * logₐ(10) / logₐ(0.65)

= 2 / logₐ(0.65)

We can use any positive base, a, for this calculation, as long as it is not equal to 1. For example, if we use base 10, we get:

log₁₀(100) / log₁₀(1-0.35) = 2 / log₁₀(0.65)

= 2 / -0.18709

= -10.69023

This means that we need to raise 10 to the power of -10.69023 to get 100 / (1-0.35), or equivalently, we need to multiply 10 by itself -10.69023 times to get the same result. This is the same as dividing 10 by itself 10.69023 times, which gives us a very small number close to zero.

Therefore, we can say that it would take about 11 consecutive losses and 4 consecutive wins in a cluster of 100 trades to reach a success rate of 35%. This repeats 7 times in each 100 trades.

Now, let's imagine a scenario where you lose 2% of your investment 11 times in a row. In this case, an initial investment of $100 would be reduced to $81 by multiplying it by 0.98 eleven times:

$100 * 0.98¹¹ = $81

But if you were to achieve four significant gains of 8% consecutively each (with a risk-reward ratio of 1:4), your account balance would rise back to $110 by multiplying $81 by 1.08 four times:

$81 * 1.08⁴ = $110

Considering all the challenges involved in achieving this, merely earning a $10 spread at best case will seem like a small reward. It's undoubtedly a tough task to accomplish.

## Expected Return Expectancy

Expectancy = [ win rate * payoff - losing rate * value at risk ] * number of trades

Expectancy with 1:4 risk reward with 35% probability traded 100 times = [ 0.35 * 4 - 0.65 * 1 ] * 100 = 0.75 * 100 = 75 units. Hence such a system has positive expectancy over large amount of iteration.

### Trend Following on NIFTY50

In this report, we explore how a simple Trend Following strategy can work on the NIFTY50 index, which is the main index for the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE). It tracks the performance of the top 50 stocks by market capitalization from 13 sectors of the Indian economy. We use a 50 month simple moving average as a signal to decide when to buy or sell. We start with $100 in 1996 and see how it grows until now. We also account for fees of 0.25% on both buying and selling, and 20% capital gains tax on the final value. 

The table below shows the results of each trade and the cumulative return of the strategy. The first trade is a bearish one, and we lose $18.4 (18.4%). The second trade is also bearish, and we lose $15.67 (19.2%). The third trade is another bearish one, and we lose $10.33 (15.7%). The fourth trade is a bullish one, and we make $61.4 (110.7%). The fifth trade is also bullish, and we make $125 (107%). The sixth trade is still open and bullish, and we make $161 (66%) so far.

The strategy turns $100 into $403 in 27 years, with an annualized return of 6.8%. After taxes and fees, the final value is $321.6, with an annualized return of 5.5% (against 10% annualized buy and hold). The strategy has a lower drawdown than buy and hold, but also a lower Sharpe ratio.

Trend Following can hunt for outliers and save investors from unpredictable events like "Tail Risk".

## Objectivity and Perspective

One challenge that arises when studying different investment strategies, such as Trend Following and value investing, is maintaining objectivity and perspective. Investors with a value-oriented approach may evaluate situations from an ownership perspective, while Trend Followers often analyze investments from a speculative standpoint. It is rare to find individuals who can objectively study and comprehend different strategies from both perspectives while maintaining a neutral viewpoint.
