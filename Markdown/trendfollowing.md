This article     provides an explanation of Trend Following, a strategy utilized in financial markets to respond to price movements. Trend Following relies on predetermined rules derived from various market price factors, without attempting to time the market or make discretionary decisions. Instead, it focuses on capturing the intermediate phase of price trends and offers protection against extreme events.

## Introduction

Trend Following is a popular investment strategy that aims to profit from sustained price trends in financial markets. It operates on the principle that market trends tend to persist over time, allowing investors to capitalize on the momentum of these trends. By using basic momentum indicators such as moving averages, Trend Following strategies determine entry and exit points in the market.

## Building a Trading System

It's alot like old cigar butt investor style. From the Trend Following Pioneer "David Herding":

**Answer the following five questions and you have a trend following trading system:**

- What market do you buy or sell at any time?

- How much of a market do you buy or sell at any time?

- When do you buy or sell a market?

- When do you get out of a losing position?

- When do you get out of a winning position?

- Why do you think you'll make money despite of multiple intermediate losses?

You want to be black or white with this. You do not want gray.

## Benefits and Considerations

Trend Following offers several benefits for investors, including:

- **Profit from Significant Trends**: By identifying and capitalizing on sustained price trends, Trend Following strategies can generate substantial profits.

- **Protection Against Extreme Events**: Trend Following strategies are designed to provide a level of protection against extreme market events such as financial crises or stock market collapses.

- **Systematic and Rule-based Approach**: Trend Following relies on predetermined rules and objective indicators, removing emotional bias and subjectivity from investment decisions.

However, it is important to consider the following aspects when implementing Trend Following strategies:

- **Whipsaw Risk**: Trend Following strategies are vulnerable to whipsaws, which occur when markets experience short-term price reversals. This can result in losses as positions are exited prematurely.

- **Mental Demands**: Trend Following can be mentally demanding, requiring discipline and adherence to predefined rules, even during periods of market volatility or conflicting signals.

## Objectivity and Perspective

One challenge that arises when studying different investment strategies, such as Trend Following and value investing, is maintaining objectivity and perspective. Investors with a value-oriented approach may evaluate situations from an ownership perspective, while Trend Followers often analyze investments from a speculative standpoint. It is rare to find individuals who can objectively study and comprehend different strategies from both perspectives while maintaining a neutral viewpoint.
