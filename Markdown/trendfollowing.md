This article provides an explanation of Trend Following, a strategy utilized in financial markets to respond to price movements. Trend Following relies on predetermined rules derived from various market price factors, without attempting to time the market or make discretionary decisions. Instead, it focuses on capturing the intermediate phase of price trends and offers protection against extreme events.

## Introduction

Trend Following is a popular strategy that aims to profit from sustained price trends in financial markets. It's speculative strategy, hence it doesn't consider ownership relationship between assets and lender. It operates on the principle that in certain situations, market trends tend to persist over time, allowing speculators to capitalize on the momentum of these trends. By using basic momentum indicators such as moving averages, Trend Following strategies determine entry and exit points in the market. Trend following strategies historically demonstrated long-term profitability.

By following disciplined and systematic approaches, trend following takes advantage of prolonged market trends (aka called fat tails or outlier). Although individual trades may result in losses, the strategy aims to capture larger trends for profit. With disciplined execution and a focus on significant trends, trend following strategies offer potential profitability for investors seeking decent returns in both up and down markets (but don't expect outperforming the benchmark due to costs associated with it)

Key factors for achieving positive results include effective risk management, diversification across 5-10 markets (e.g., bonds, stocks, commodities, currencies, various ETFs etc), and proper position sizing. Cutting losses quickly and allowing profitable trades to run which contributes to a favorable risk-reward ratio. While trend following does not guarantee success in every trade or market condition, its positive expectancy has been observed over the long term. Notably, managed futures funds like DUNE Capital and AQR have employed trend following with success.

## The Pareto Principle

We often hear comments like trend following doesn’t work. Well, that is actually half the truth. Trend following doesn’t work on a single underlying like a stock or an index. It relies on the law of large numbers to make it work. This is because trend following also fall under the Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule. It states that for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. If we translate this principle to investing, it would mean that 80% of the profits come from only 20% of the trades we make in our portfolio. What this means is that most of the time, we will feel like our trades are not working and we are only making our brokers happy

## Building a Trading System

It's alot like old cigar butt investing style, hence no discretion or prediction is used. From the Trend Following Pioneer "David Herding":

**Answer the following six questions and you have a trend following trading system:**

- What market do you buy or sell at any time?

- How much of a market do you buy or sell at any time?

- When do you buy or sell a market?

- When do you get out of a losing position?

- When do you get out of a winning position?

- Why do you think you'll make money despite of multiple intermediate losses?

You want to be black or white with this. You do not want gray.

## Benefits and Considerations

Trend Following offers several benefits for market participants, including:

- **Profit from Significant Trends**: By identifying and capitalizing on sustained price trends, Trend Following strategies can generate substantial profits.

- **Protection Against Extreme Events**: Trend Following strategies are designed to provide a level of protection against extreme market events such as financial crises or stock market collapses.

- **Systematic and Rule-based Approach**: Trend Following relies on predetermined rules and objective indicators, removing emotional bias and subjectivity from investment decisions.

But please consider the following aspects (risks) when implementing Trend Following strategies:

- **Whipsaw Risk**: Trend Following strategies are vulnerable to whipsaws, which occur when markets experience short-term price reversals. This can result in losses as positions are exited prematurely.

- **Mental Demands**: Trend Following can be mentally demanding, requiring discipline and adherence to predefined rules, even during periods of market volatility or conflicting signals.

## Objectivity and Perspective

One challenge that arises when studying different investment strategies, such as Trend Following and value investing, is maintaining objectivity and perspective. Investors with a value-oriented approach may evaluate situations from an ownership perspective, while Trend Followers often analyze investments from a speculative standpoint. It is rare to find individuals who can objectively study and comprehend different strategies from both perspectives while maintaining a neutral viewpoint.
