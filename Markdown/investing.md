# Lessons from Historical Examples of Undervalued and Overvalued Stocks

Investing in stocks can be a rewarding but also challenging endeavor. One of the key skills that investors need to develop is the ability to identify undervalued and overvalued stocks. Undervalued stocks are stocks that trade below their assumed value, while overvalued stocks are stocks that trade above their assumed value. Investing in undervalued stocks can offer attractive returns, while investing in overvalued stocks can expose investors to losses.

But how can investors find undervalued and overvalued stocks? And what are the factors that cause stocks to be undervalued or overvalued? To answer these questions, it may be helpful to look at some historical examples of undervalued and overvalued stocks before 1960 and learn from them.

## Undervalued Stocks

Undervalued stocks are often caused by one of these four reasons:

- The general market is down
- The sector or industry is out of favor
- The company is misunderstood or overlooked
- The company is facing temporary problems
- The company is trading at high margin but at low multiple or low margin buy high multiple (margins and PE multiple are inversely proportional)

These reasons create a gap between the market price and the intrinsic value of the stock, which can be exploited by value investors who do thorough research and analysis and have a long-term horizon.

Here are some examples of undervalued stocks by reason before 1960:

- **The general market is down**: In 1929, the stock market crashed due to the Great Depression and the Wall Street panic. Many stocks became undervalued as investors panicked and sold their holdings. One example was **General Electric** (NYSE: GE), which dropped from $396 in 1929 to $34 in 1932. The company had strong fundamentals, a diversified portfolio and a leading position in electrical appliances, but the market ignored its value. The stock recovered and reached new highs in the following decades.

- **The sector or industry is out of favor**: In 1957, the aerospace sector was hit hard by the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union, which sparked fears of a nuclear war and a space race. Many aerospace stocks became undervalued as investors avoided or sold them. One example was **Lockheed Martin** (NYSE: LMT), which fell from $38 in 1957 to $26 in 1958. The company had strong fundamentals, a dominant position in military aircraft and a growing presence in space exploration, but the market undervalued its prospects. The stock rebounded and outperformed the sector.
    
- **The company is misunderstood or overlooked**: In 1955, the chemical sector was dominated by a few large companies that had a monopoly on patents and research. Many smaller chemical companies were undervalued as investors overlooked or ignored them. One example was **Dow Chemical** (NYSE: DOW), which traded at $45 in 1955, while its larger rival DuPont traded at $250. The company had strong fundamentals, a diversified portfolio of products and a competitive edge in innovation, but the market underestimated its potential. The stock soared and reached new highs in the following years.

- **The company is facing temporary problems**: In 1959, the consumer discretionary sector was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown measures. Many consumer discretionary stocks became undervalued as investors expected lower consumer spending and demand. One example was **Hasbro** (NASDAQ: HAS), which dropped to its lowest level since 2013. The company had strong fundamentals, a diversified portfolio of brands and franchises and a growing digital presence, but the market underestimated its resilience. The stock recovered and outperformed the sector.

## Overvalued Stocks

Overvalued stocks are often caused by one of these four reasons:

- The general market is up
- The sector or industry is in favor
- The company is hyped or followed
- The company is facing permanent problems
- The company has both high PE and high profit margin (margins and PE multiples are directly proportional)

These reasons create a gap between the market price and the intrinsic value of the stock, which can be exploited by short sellers who do thorough research and analysis and have a short-term horizon.

Here are some examples of overvalued stocks by reason before 1960:

- **The general market is up**: In 1929, the stock market soared to record highs due to the economic boom and the speculative frenzy. Many stocks became overvalued as investors bought them with borrowed money and unrealistic expectations. One example was **Radio Corporation of America** (RCA), which rose from $11 in 1924 to $549 in 1929. The company had strong fundamentals, a leading position in radio broadcasting and a promising future in television, but the market overvalued it.

- **The sector or industry is in favor**: In 1955, the automobile sector was one of the most popular sectors due to the post-war economic growth and the consumer demand for cars. Many automobile stocks became overvalued as investors bought them with high hopes and optimism. One example was **Ford Motor Company** (NYSE: F), which rose from $54 in 1954 to $113 in 1955. The company had strong fundamentals, a dominant position in the car industry and a loyal customer base, but the market overvalued its prospects. The stock declined and reached $44 in 1957.

- **The company is hyped or followed**: In 1959, the technology sector was one of the most exciting sectors due to the innovation and advancement in electronics and computers. Many technology stocks became overvalued as investors followed them with enthusiasm and curiosity. One example was **Texas Instruments** (NASDAQ: TXN), which rose from $25 in 1958 to $217 in 1959. The company had strong fundamentals, a pioneering role in integrated circuits and a growing presence in calculators and computers, but the market overvalued its potential. The stock dropped and reached $50 in 1962.

- **The company is facing permanent problems**: In 1956, the tobacco sector was one of the most profitable sectors due to the high demand and low regulation for cigarettes. Many tobacco stocks became overvalued as investors ignored or dismissed the health risks and legal liabilities associated with smoking. One example was **American Tobacco Company** (ATC), which traded at $60 in 1956, while its earnings per share were only $1.50. The company had weak fundamentals, a declining market share and a looming threat of lawsuits, but the market overvalued its value. The stock plummeted and reached $10 in 1962.

## Conclusion

These historical examples of undervalued and overvalued stocks show that investors need to be careful and diligent when evaluating stocks. They also show that there are opportunities to profit from both undervalued and overvalued stocks, depending on the strategy and the timing. Investors should always do their own research and analysis before investing in any stock, and avoid following the crowd or the hype blindly.

**Note:** *It is quoted by Graham that "the blandishments of a salesman offering new common stock issues during bull markets should be resisted by the intelligent investor". It is noted that while a salesman may point out various issues that have had market advances, this is often part of a speculative atmosphere. The gains made from such investments may be outweighed by losses, with investors potentially losing more than they gain. An example given is the initial public offering of Apple in December 1980, where shares were sold for $22. It is pointed out that it was impossible to know at the time that Apple would become the first trillion dollar company. Another example given is the IPO of VA Linux, which had more projected potential and hype than Apple. It is stated that on its first day of trading, VA Linux opened at $30 and closed at $239.25. However, three years later, the stock was selling for $1.19. It is noted that while there are only a few examples similar to Apple, there are thousands similar to VA Linux. Future prospects remain uncertain even for Buffet. Predicting them is subjective. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) is only as reliable as your business intuition. Capital is safeguarded not by a margin of safety, but through diversification. To generate alpha, embrace calculated risk.*
