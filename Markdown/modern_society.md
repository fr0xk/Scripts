# Reflections on Modern Life

The modern-day world is great if you want to:

- work in a cubicle,
- come home and play VR and video games,
- scroll through Instagram, and
- call it a life.

Now when measured by factors like the "number of family dinners per week" or "people who say they have close friends," these are important metrics for mental health that are at an all-time low.

But, to my best guess, maybe people have never actually liked each other. Many family dinners leave individuals infuriated with numerous difficult discussions and disagreements. Some families are just as toxic. A lot of people have been cheated by their closest relatives and blood. This is the byproduct of forced conservatism we've had for a long time; corporations observed this and exploited our behaviors.

This is just my humble opinion.
