## India's Workforce, Taxation, and Social Security (Based on 2022 Data)

### Introduction

India's workforce exhibits a diverse composition, with significant portions employed in government jobs, the IT sector, and the unorganised sector. The taxation system, primarily funded by taxpayers, plays a crucial role in financing various public services and development projects. However, inefficiencies and corruption have hampered the effective utilization of tax revenue, leading to fiscal deficits and economic challenges.

**Note:** In India, there is a perception that individuals who do not attend IITs, IIMs, or prestigious professions such as doctors, lawyers, IAS, or IFS are considered losers. This is due to the country's large population, which makes it more difficult to gain admission to these institutions. Only after leaving India, we realize that people in more developed countries do not struggle as much for basic necessities. They can live good lives with an average or below average education. This is because these countries have invested in their people and infrastructure, creating a more equitable society. We should cherish India because it is our home and where we were born and raised but we should not glorify the struggle. We can love our country and still admit its flaws. Ignoring these flaws will ensure that no progress is ever made. Some people in India believe that blue-collar jobs are the way to go here but corporate jobs abroad still offer better opportunities and perks. They pay 5-10 times more, and inflation in developed countries is usually below 2%. If you negotiate well, you will thrive. Problem with India is that lower-level roles in India are seriously underpaid. People usually start making decent money in corporate jobs after 5-6 years of experience. Unless there is a strong reason to stay in India, such as taking care of sick parents, it is wiser to leave, earn more, save, and return to start a business that creates jobs back home.

### Government Jobs and Taxation

* As of 2022, around 17% of India's workforce is employed in government jobs, which are supported by taxpayers' money. [Source: Business Today India - "Government Jobs in India"]
* Approximately 5% to 6% of government employees are estimated to be taxpayers, while the rest may engage in tax evasion through various means, leading to a tax gap of around \\$100 billion. [Source: The Times of India - "India's Tax Base Erodes as only 2.3% of Population Pay Income Tax"]

### IT Sector and Economic Impact

* The IT sector comprises approximately 4% of India's total workforce, with a predominant focus on providing services to clients in Western countries and receiving payment in foreign currencies, such as dollars.

* IT sector employees generally earn higher salaries, especially when wages are converted from foreign currencies to rupees. This leads to a significant difference in average incomes compared to government workers. [Source: NASSCOM - "IT Industry in India: Unlocking Opportunities"]
* Despite higher pay, IT workers often face job insecurity and limited benefits, especially in the wake of global economic fluctuations. [Source: Livemint - "Indian IT Sector Is Back in Business but Without Its Spark"]

### Tax Revenue and Corruption

* Tax revenue in India is derived from various sources, including income taxes paid by government workers, IT sector employees, Goods and Services Tax (GST), and corporate taxes.
* According to a report from Transparency International India, corruption continues to be a concern, with an estimated 36% of Indians experiencing bribery while availing public services in 2022. [Source: Transparency International India - "India Corruption Survey 2022"]
* Widespread tax evasion and non-compliance have reduced the government's ability to invest adequately in crucial sectors like infrastructure and education.
* Insufficient tax collection and improper utilization of funds have contributed to fiscal deficits and fluctuations in the value of the Indian rupee. [Source: Reserve Bank of India - "Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy"]

### Unorganised Sector and Social Security

* The unorganised sector encompasses a substantial majority (around 82-85%) of India's workforce.
* Workers in the unorganised sector often face challenges such as low wages, inadequate working conditions, and a lack of social security benefits.
* In 2022, the government made efforts to provide social security to workers in the unorganised sector through schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-Dhan (PM-SYM) Yojana, which aims to provide pension benefits to unorganised workers.

* However, the implementation of social security laws and schemes remains a challenge, and only a fraction of unorganised sector workers have access to such benefits.

### Conclusion

Government jobs typically pay a base salary of $500 or more, plus additional benefits. Salaries in the regulated IT sector range from $250 to $3000, depending on skills and position. It is difficult to calculate the median salary in India because 90% of the economy is informal. Only 2.3% of the population pays income tax, so there is no reliable data on earnings in the informal sector. This lack of data makes it difficult to track labor exploitation and other problems in the informal economy. The cost of living in India varies depending on location. In tier 3 cities, the cost of basic survival is around $250 per month (equivalent to a lifestyle of $2000 in USA). This means that a person would need to earn at least $250 per month to meet their basic needs including adequate nutrition, a roof over head, healthy sanitary measures and toilets, transportation, necessary education and basic healthcare. Many people in India earn less than this, and they may have to rely on loans or other forms of financial assistance to make ends meet. The parents of the person in question had no idea where he got the money is concerning. It is either that he received the money from a loan shark or other unscrupulous source or he earned the money through illegal activities.

India's diverse workforce, consisting of government workers, IT sector employees, and a vast unorganised sector, plays a crucial role in the country's economic growth. However, the taxation system's inefficiencies and prevailing corruption hinder the effective utilization of tax revenue, resulting in fiscal deficits and challenges in crucial sectors. Addressing these issues and ensuring proper implementation of social security schemes for unorganised sector workers are vital steps towards achieving a more equitable and prosperous society.
