## Overview

Contrarian investing is an investment strategy that involves going against the prevailing market trends to generate profits. The idea is that markets are subject to herding behavior augmented by fear and greed, making markets periodically over- and underpriced. Contrarian investors look for opportunities to buy undervalued stocks that have been oversold by the market and sell overvalued stocks that have been overbought by the market.

A technical contrarian investing strategy uses indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to measure the momentum and strength of price movements and identify potential entry and exit points for trades. The RSI is a bounded oscillator that ranges from 0 to 100, with values below 30 indicating oversold conditions and values above 70 indicating overbought conditions. A median value of 50 is often used as a reference point to determine the direction of the trend.

## Strategy Details

Based on your input, a possible technical contrarian investing strategy could be:

- Set RSI period to monthly, set period to 45. This means that the RSI will be calculated based on the closing prices of the last 45 months.
- Set oversold at 40, overbought at 70 and median value at 50. This means that the RSI will signal a potential buy opportunity when it falls below 40 and a potential sell opportunity when it rises above 70. The median value of 50 will indicate whether the trend is bullish or bearish.
- Buy when the RSI falls below 50 and a green bullish ticker (momentum reversal) shows up. This means that the contrarian investor will look for stocks that have been underperforming the market and are showing signs of a reversal in momentum. A green bullish ticker is a candlestick pattern that indicates a strong upward price movement after a downtrend.
- Start selling or reducing weight when RSI crosses 70 or more. This means that the contrarian investor will start taking profits or cutting losses when the stock becomes overbought and loses momentum.
- Don't add more if existing positions are at drawdown. This means that the contrarian investor will not increase their exposure to a losing trade, but rather wait for a better opportunity to enter or exit.
- Run 20-35 positions simultaneously for avoiding risk of ruin. This means that the contrarian investor will diversify their portfolio across different stocks and sectors to reduce their overall risk and volatility.

## Expected Value Calculation

You can calculate expected value by [(1+g)*(future value/present value)]^(1/n) where g is expected growth rate, future value is the value that is expected to mean revert, n is number of years values are expected to mean revert. This formula can help you estimate the potential return of a contrarian investment based on your assumptions about the growth rate and mean reversion of the stock price.

## Risks and Challenges

Contrarian investing is not without risks and challenges. Some of them are:

- **Time horizon and patience**: Contrarian investing may require a long time horizon and patience, as it may take a while for the market to recognize the true value of a stock . Contrarian investors may have to endure periods of underperformance or losses before their strategy pays off.
- **Psychological pressure**: Contrarian investing may involve going against popular opinion and consensus, which can be psychologically difficult . Contrarian investors may face criticism or ridicule from other investors who follow the crowd. They may also suffer from self-doubt or confirmation bias when their views are challenged by new information or events.
- **Research and analysis**: Contrarian investing may require extensive research and analysis, as it is not enough to simply buy low and sell high . Contrarian investors need to have a solid rationale for their investment decisions and be able to distinguish between stocks that are cheap for a good reason (value traps) and stocks that are cheap for no good reason (bargains).
- **Declining industries or companies**: Contrarian investing may involve taking positions in declining industries or companies that are facing financial difficulties
