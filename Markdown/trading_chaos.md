The presence of smart traders with expensive algorithms may not affect your trading strategy if you have a long-term perspective and a solid risk management plan.

If HFTs cause temporary price fluctuations, value investors may take advantage of the lower prices and increase the demand, stabilizing the market. However, HFTs can also have positive effects on market liquidity and efficiency. The extent of their price impact depends on various factors such as market conditions, trading volume, and order size.

It is unlikely that HFTs can manipulate prices by a large margin such as -50%, as that would trigger circuit breakers and regulatory scrutiny. However, smaller price movements of -2% or -10% may still occur due to HFTs or other market participants. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the risks and opportunities in the market and adjust your trading strategy accordingly.
