The presence of smart traders with expensive algorithms may not affect your trading strategy if you have a long-term perspective and a solid risk management plan.

If high-frequency traders (HFTs) cause temporary price fluctuations, value investors may take advantage of the lower prices and increase the demand, stabilizing the market. HFTs can also have positive effects on market liquidity and efficiency. The extent of their price impact depends on various factors such as market conditions, trading volume, and order size.

It is unlikely that HFTs can manipulate prices by a large margin such as -50%, as that would trigger circuit breakers and regulatory scrutiny. However, smaller price movements of -2% or -10% may still occur due to HFTs or other market participants. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the risks and opportunities in the market and adjust your trading strategy accordingly.

## Retail Trading Strategies

Retail traders are individual investors who trade on their own accounts using online platforms or brokers. Retail traders often look at liquidity, volatility, and volume when deciding what stocks to buy. Some tools that retail traders use to pinpoint buying points include candlestick chart patterns, trendlines and triangles, and volume.

There are different types of retail trading strategies, such as:

- **Day trading**: Buying and selling stocks within the same day, taking advantage of small price movements.
- **Swing trading**: Holding stocks for a few days or weeks, following the short-term trends and momentum.
- **Position trading**: Holding stocks for months or years, based on the long-term fundamentals and macroeconomic factors.
- **Scalping**: Making frequent trades with small profits, using high leverage and low commissions.
- **Options trading**: Buying and selling contracts that give the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price and time.

Each strategy has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the trader's goals, risk tolerance, capital, and skills. Retail traders need to have a well-thought-out plan for making trading decisions, such as:

- What they need to see before they enter a trade
- Where they will exit and how much they will risk
- Where they will place their stop loss

Retail traders also need to keep up with the latest stock market news and events that affect stocks, such as interest rates, earnings reports, economic indicators, etc. They can use various sources of information, such as online news outlets, financial websites, podcasts, blogs, etc.

## The Good, The Bad And The Ugly Of Trading Education

Professional traders know more than retail traders, yes, but almost none of that additional knowledge applies to retail traders or what they are going to do; it’s for trading other people’s money within an institutional trading environment. Retail traders don’t necessarily need to know how to do that.

As a retail trader, everything you need to know is available online for free or at a reasonable cost. Some of the best sources of trading education are:

- [Tastytrade](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/): A free platform that focuses on options trading and provides live shows, videos, podcasts, blogs, etc.
- [Option Alpha](https://optionalpha.com/): A free platform that focuses on options trading and provides courses, videos, podcasts, blogs, etc.
- [TechniTrader](https://technitrader.com/): A paid platform that focuses on technical stock trading and provides courses, videos, webinars, blogs, etc.

These platforms offer comprehensive and practical trading education for retail traders of all levels. They cover topics such as:

- Trading basics: Terminology, concepts, types of orders, etc.
- Trading strategies: How to use different techniques and tools to trade stocks and options
- Trading psychology: How to manage emotions, discipline, risk-reward ratio
- Trading plan: How to create a personalized plan for your goals
- Trading performance: How to track your results and improve your skills

However, not all sources of trading education are reliable or useful. Some of the pitfalls to avoid are:

- Scams: Beware of platforms or individuals that promise unrealistic returns or guaranteed profits from trading. They may charge exorbitant fees or sell useless products or services.
- Hype: Beware of platforms or individuals that use sensationalist language or exaggerated claims to attract attention or followers. They may lack credibility or expertise.
- Bias: Beware of platforms or individuals that have a vested interest or agenda in promoting certain stocks or strategies. They may have conflicts of interest or ulterior motives.

Therefore, it is important to do your own research and due diligence before trusting any source of trading education. Look for platforms or individuals that have:

- Transparency: They disclose their credentials, track record, and performance.
- Credibility: They provide evidence, data, and references to support their claims.
- Objectivity: They present both the pros and cons of trading and do not push any agenda.
