# Nurturing Civic Duties: Unraveling India's Historical Echoes for a Brighter Future

India's society is currently grappling with significant challenges stemming from the neglect of basic civic duties by its citizens. This pattern finds historical echoes in the past, such as the failure to pay taxes properly since ancient times and a lack of civic engagement since the periods of foreign rule. These issues persist today, with tax evasion, an unorganized sector in disarray despite being a crucial part of India's GDP, low voter turnout in elections, a lack of participation in jury duty, and widespread disregard for the law. Consequently, India finds itself in a state of disarray, mirroring historical instances of societal turmoil.

One can draw parallels to ancient history, where tax evasion was prevalent in various kingdoms and empires. For example, during the Maurya Empire, tax evasion was a common issue, leading to a decline in revenue and weakening the state's administration. Similarly, under Mughal rule, tax evasion by nobles and powerful elites hampered effective governance and fiscal stability. These historical instances demonstrate how non-compliance with tax obligations hampers the state's ability to function and provide essential services.

Another historical parallel can be observed in the lack of civic engagement during foreign rule. Low participation in earlier days in local elections and indifference towards the administrative system allowed the colonial government to exert control without substantial resistance. The lack of civic participation during this time contributed to India's subjugation and curtailed efforts for self-governance. This historical context accentuates the significance of active citizenship and civic duties in shaping the destiny of a nation. The challenges faced by India in terms of civic duties extend beyond historical precedence. The apathy towards voting in elections, for example, has modern parallels to the low voter turnout during the early years of Indian independence. In the first general elections held in 1952, the voter turnout was just above 45%, reflecting a similar lack of interest and participation. This highlights the importance of active engagement in the democratic process to safeguard the interests of the people and promote accountable governance.

Furthermore, the disregard for jury duty finds historical resonance in instances where mistrust in the judicial system prevailed. During the Emergency in the 1970s, the judiciary faced a crisis of credibility due to compromised decisions and erosion of public trust. This historical event underscores the significance of citizen participation in upholding the integrity of the justice system through jury duty and active involvement. The prevailing corruption within the government, police, and courts also has historical antecedents. Throughout India's history, there have been instances of corrupt rulers, administrators, and judicial officers. The widespread corruption witnessed today can be seen as a continuation of this historical trend, emphasizing the need for a vigilant citizenry to demand transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct from those in power.

Despite these historical and contemporary challenges, hope remains. Historical examples also provide instances where individuals and communities came together to address societal issues. The freedom struggle against British rule serves as a poignant reminder of collective action and the power of citizen engagement. The efforts of prominent leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and countless others, along with the support and participation of the masses, led to India's independence in 1947.

Drawing inspiration from these historical events, the people of India can reshape their society by prioritizing their civic duties. By fulfilling obligations such as paying taxes, participating actively in elections, engaging in jury duty, and adhering to the law, India can transcend its current challenges. Just as historical movements have shaped the nation's destiny, a renewed sense of civic responsibility can steer India towards a brighter future, leaving behind the state of disarray and fostering a society built on the principles of active citizenship, transparency, and accountable governance.
