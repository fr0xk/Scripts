# Of Langage's Mirthful Passage Through Tyme

Whan [when] that yon English tongue, in the year of grace foure hundred and fifty, did commence its tale, it spaketh [spoke] a language hight [called] Old English, wherein "sunu" resonated as "son." Yet anon [soon], as the Norsemen sailed hither, Old Norse did cast its lot into the language pot, and "take" and "give" did wend [go] their way into the linguistic fare. With the Norman Conquest of ten sixty and six, French didste [did] make its entrance, transmuting "beef" into the melodie [melody] of "b≈ìuf." Into the Middle English realm of tales by Chaucer, 'twixt eleven fifty and fifteen hundred, did "knight" morph its sound, and "knee" did twain [change] in its discourse. The advent of Caxton's press in fourteen seventy and six revealed the tales of "adventure" and "jazz," as if the printing press itself were an ancient bard spinning the latest hits. In the age of Renaissance, 'twixt fifteen hundred and sixty and fifty, Shakespeare's quill did grace the language with phrases like "To be or not to be," probably leaving folks pondering existential questions over their morning tea. The Great Vowel Shift in fourteen hundred to sixteen hundred did alter the song, rendering "time" to the cadence of "teem," as if vowels decided to shake things up and keep words on their toes. As the colonies did burgeon [grow] in sixteen hundred to eighteen hundred, American English made merry with "cookie" and "fall," proving that even language enjoys a good seasonal treat. The Industrial Revolution's machine hum in seventeen sixty to eighteen forty ushered in words like "steam engine" and "locomotive," giving rise to steam-powered debates about whether a locomotive could outrun a snail. The nineteenthand twentieth centuries bore witness to global tongues, harmonizing "football" and "biscuit," yet diversifying with American English's "candy" and "truck," leading to debates on the sweetness of candies and the truck-sized portions of American snacks. The digital age's dawn in the twentieth century brought "email" and "website" into the lingual tapestry, as if our words decided to go digital and take a shortcut through cyberspace. Peering into the morrow [future], the fusion with artificial wit foretells a tale of augmented cognitive might, while the internet's pervasive hand shapes English into a pliant tongue, weaving global bonds and creating memes faster than one can say "LOL." Prithee [please], contribute ye [you] to this ongoing tale of English, for in jest and jollity, our words find their mirth!
