# The Complex Puzzle of India's Caste System

![Racism Backfires](https://i.imgur.com/eazrp0k.jpg)

India's vibrant fabric is entangled with complex threads of caste, poverty, and traditions that can bewilder outsiders. Juggling socialist and nationalist goals, the government grapples with the irony and clashes sparked by religious tensions. Pollution chokes the air, bureaucracy throws up colossal hurdles, and the streets brim with buzzing rickshaws, stray dogs, and sacred cows. Trucks could vanish in the gaping potholes, the heat scorches relentlessly, and the chasm between rich and poor yawns wide open.

Casteism in India is far more complex than it seems. While you have the traditional hierarchy with different castes, there's also the issue of Dalits, considered "untouchables." This system, twisted by Aryan influence, is deeply unfair and treats some people as less than human.

However, oddly enough, the idea of equality in India itself relies on this very caste system. You see, the government set up affirmative action programs based on caste, aiming to give equal opportunities to those lower in the hierarchy. It's a strange situation where a system built on inequality is used to try and achieve the opposite.

So, casteism is like a tangled knot. It's deeply ingrained in society, creates immense injustice, but also oddly, has become woven into the fabric of how the government tries to address that very injustice. It's a complex issue with no easy answers. In today's India, politics are a messy game. Different groups use their caste identities for their own gain, while others take advantage of the divisions. The old caste system no longer holds weight. You might find Brahmins living humble lives while Dalits rise to success. It's become a tool for political maneuvering, not a reflection of people's roles. For example, being a Brahmin doesn't automatically give me any special rights over a Dalit person anymore. This feels similar to the US, where movements like LGBTQ+ and Black Lives Matter are tackling inequalities and challenging the existing power structure. BJP affiliation that I got after some emotional manipulation from local BJP workers is mainly for show, and it's handy for road rage incidents. Politics here is more circus than substance. Authenticity takes a back seat to crowd-pleasing tactics.

India's caste system came to be, but the oldest and most traditional one is quite bizarre. It claims that a god named Brahma created the different castes out of his own body! Supposedly, the Brahmins (priests and scholars) came from his mouth, the Kshatriyas (warriors and rulers) from his arms, the Vaishyas (farmers and merchants) from his thighs, and the Shudras (laborers and servants) from his feet. Different theories try to explain the caste system, but none tell the whole story. One theory says it's about race, like a club for light-skinned "Aryans" who ruled over everyone else. Another theory says it's about politics, with rulers using caste as a tool to stay in power. Reservations are a big example of this – now everyone seems to have a category, from upper castes with their "economically weaker sections" quota to lower castes, women, and practically anyone else. But even if you don't fit in any category, you're still stuck with a label – the "no class" class. And guess what? You'll still face discrimination because of it. With the "economically weaker sections" category for upper castes, it's like they've given up trying to fight the system and just joined it. The "occupation" theory claims the caste system is simply about jobs: Brahmins leading ceremonies, Kshatriyas defending people, Vaishyas trading, and Shudras doing manual labor. But none of these theories are perfect. The caste system is a complex puzzle with countless pieces, shaped by history, culture, religion, politics, the economy, and even human nature itself.

Hence I have following suggestions for improvement of our racist culture:

1. Generalize but don't discriminate based on superficial backgrounds that one has no control over.

2. Don't engage in any extremist views or policies that violates basic human rights including the right to life, liberty, and security of person; the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion (except personal laws); the right to freedom of expression; the right to assembly and association; the right to work and to just and favorable conditions of work; the right to social security; the right to education; and the right to participate in the government of one's country.

## Glorious culture and manipulation/oppression against women, slavery and class hierarchy 

Ancient texts like the Vedas, Bible, and Quran carry spiritual messages that go beyond their literal meanings, shaped by the social contexts of their eras, specially amongst women, slave master relationship and social class hierarchy. They contain both oppressive and positive verses. Look beyond the surface to uncover deeper meanings.

- Vedas: "Look down, not up; keep your feet close together; let not (men)behold your ankles, for from having been a brahmā you have become a feminine le." (Rig Veda 8.33.19)
  
- Purusha Sukta (Rig Veda 10.90): This hymn describes the cosmic being Purusha's sacrifice, from which different social groups originate: Brahmins from his mouth, Kshatriyas from his arms, Vaishyas from his thighs, and Shudras from his feet. This is often seen as the source of the four-fold caste system.

- Chhandogya Upanishad (5.10.7): This passage suggests that good deeds lead to higher births (Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya), while bad deeds lead to lower births (dog, pig, Chandala). This reinforces the idea of karma and caste hierarchy.

>Note: The terms "Varna" and "Jati" are often conflated. Varna refers to broad occupational divisions, while Jati is the complex and fluid system of castes as we know them today. Vedas primarily mention Varnas, not rigid Jatis. Verses like the Purusha Sukta are often interpreted symbolically, representing the different functions and qualities necessary for a balanced society, not literal birth hierarchy. Vedic texts were composed over centuries, and their interpretations have evolved over time. Later texts like the Manusmriti codified and rigidified the caste system, which wasn't the original intent of the Vedas.

- Bible: "Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ." (Ephesians 6:5)

- Quran: "And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah is worse than killing. And do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers". (Quran 2:191)
   
- Bible: "I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet." (1 Timothy 2:12)

- Quran: "Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand..." (Quran 4:34)

- Modern Example (Misogynistic): "A good wife is one who serves her husband in the morning like a mother does, loves him during the day like a sister does, and pleases him like a prostitute at night" (Chanakya's "Arthashastra," 4th century BCE)
  
Before you yell at me like a pleb & take your pick from the Holy Trinity of Religious Excuses:

> You don't understand it
>
> Out of Context!™
>
> You need faith to understand!
>
> You see, the original meaning in Hebrew/Greek/whatever culture is..." **
   
Remember, these quotes are products of their times. Critically evaluate their impact on equality and dignity while considering their historical context.

## Modern State of Casteism
The whole caste system deal in India is like a loop-de-loop roller coaster in present state. People's beliefs and what they do because of them keep bouncing off each other, making the system even stronger. Think of it like a cycle where how people see things shapes what they do, and what they do then affects how they see things. It's everywhere in society: Social media trends shape what we buy, and what we buy influences the next social media trends. People's increasing fear of a neighborhood being unsafe leads to fewer people going out, making the area seem even more dangerous. People's fear of a bank collapse leading them to withdraw their money, causing the bank's actual collapse. People's fear of a financial crisis leads them to hoard money, causing a decrease in spending and further worsening the crisis. When people panic and start selling stocks during a market crash, their actions can actually trigger more panic and worsen the crash & so on.

Back in the day, Hindu culture put a "made with religious beliefs" stamp on it. Stories, traditions, and holy texts justified this system that gave different roles to different groups. Those ideas had a backstage pass to social and economic decisions, like pushing some folks to the side and treating them differently. Those actions then pumped up the beliefs even more! The way people treated each other reinforced those cultural ideas. This whole loopity-loop thing has made the caste system unbreakable, even though some folks tried to change it. Even when they brought in policies to help lower castes, it added more twists to the ride. Those perks made people show off their caste labels even more, and some people felt left out and ticked off. So the cycle spun on, making things more complicated than it was originally intended.
