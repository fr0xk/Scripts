# The Complex Puzzle of India's Caste System

![Racism Backfires](https://i.imgur.com/eazrp0k.jpg)

India's tapestry weaves together casteism, poverty, and cultural norms that often baffle outsiders. The government juggles socialist and nationalist agendas, while religious dynamics add irony and conflict. Pollution runs rampant, bureaucracy is a monumental challenge, and the streets teem with rickshaws, dogs, and cows. Potholes could swallow a truck, the heat is intense, and the wealth gap is glaring.

Speaking of casteism, it's a lot more intricate than it looks. Alongside the traditional caste hierarchy, the concept of Dalits, or untouchables, exists. Aryan influence has twisted perceptions, creating an unjust system where some are treated as subhuman. Oddly, equality depends on this very casteism, as the government established the system to offer equal opportunities to lower castes. This is a political playground now, with groups exploiting their own and others capitalizing on the situation. Caste roles blur in modern India. Brahmins might live simply while Dalits prosper. The caste system has divorced from its original meaning and become a political tool. As a Brahmin, I have no special rights over Dalits today. It's a bit like the US, where movements like LGBTQ+ and Black Lives Matter challenge power dynamics. BJP affiliation that I got after some emotional manipulation from local BJP workers is mainly for show, and it's handy for road rage incidents. Politics here is more circus than substance. Authenticity takes a back seat to crowd-pleasing tactics.

Actually, India's caste system is this colossal puzzle with dfferent theories. First, the traditional one says it's divine sorting: Brahmins from the mouth, Kshatriyas from the arms, Vaishyas from the thighs, and Shudras from the feet of a god named Brahma. Then there's the racial theory. It's like an Aryan club where fair-skinned Aryans led and others were demoted. The political angle, rulers played the caste card for power. How? Reservations? Now upper castes have EWS reservations, lower class, woman, practically everyone has a class. If there's none, then you still have a class - "no class" class. Yes, that's a class and you will be discriminated accordingly. With EWS, UR team is basically now "can't beat them, join them" gang. The occupational theory turned job titles into classes. Brahmins led, Kshatriyas defended, Vaishyas traded, and Shudras labored. But no theory's golden. The caste system's a cube with a million sides. Theories are bits of the solution. It's complex, mixing history, culture, religion, politics, economy, and human nature.

Hence I have following suggestions for improvement of our racist culture:

1. Generalize but don't discriminate based on superficial backgrounds that one has no control over.

2. Don't engage in any extremist views or policies that violates basic human rights including the right to life, liberty, and security of person; the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion (except personal laws); the right to freedom of expression; the right to assembly and association; the right to work and to just and favorable conditions of work; the right to social security; the right to education; and the right to participate in the government of one's country. If you want to judge, judge yourself, your own beliefs. Be your own racist and ask for your own reservation. Keep doing it until we have 100 quotas for 99 net positions.

## Glorious culture and manipulation/oppression 

Ancient texts like the Vedas, Bible, and Quran carry spiritual messages that go beyond their literal meanings, shaped by the social contexts of their eras, specially amongst women. They contain both oppressive and positive verses. Look beyond the surface to uncover deeper meanings.

- Vedas: "Look down, not up; keep your feet close together; let not (men)behold your ankles, for from having been a brahmā you have become a feminine le." (Rig Veda 8.33.19)
  
- Purusha Sukta (Rig Veda 10.90): This hymn describes the cosmic being Purusha's sacrifice, from which different social groups originate: Brahmins from his mouth, Kshatriyas from his arms, Vaishyas from his thighs, and Shudras from his feet. This is often seen as the source of the four-fold caste system.

- Chhandogya Upanishad (5.10.7): This passage suggests that good deeds lead to higher births (Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya), while bad deeds lead to lower births (dog, pig, Chandala). This reinforces the idea of karma and caste hierarchy.

>Note: The terms "Varna" and "Jati" are often conflated. Varna refers to broad occupational divisions, while Jati is the complex and fluid system of castes as we know them today. Vedas primarily mention Varnas, not rigid Jatis. Verses like the Purusha Sukta are often interpreted symbolically, representing the different functions and qualities necessary for a balanced society, not literal birth hierarchy. Vedic texts were composed over centuries, and their interpretations have evolved over time. Later texts like the Manusmriti codified and rigidified the caste system, which wasn't the original intent of the Vedas.

- Bible: "Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ." (Ephesians 6:5)

- Quran: "And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah is worse than killing. And do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers". (Quran 2:191)
   
1. **Bible:**
   - "I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet." (1 Timothy 2:12)
   
3. **Quran:**
   - "Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand..." (Quran 4:34)
   
7. **Modern Example (Misogynistic):**
   
   - "A good wife is one who serves her husband in the morning like a mother does, loves him during the day like a sister does, and pleases him like a prostitute at night" (Chanakya's "Arthashastra," 4th century BCE)
  
Before you yell at me like a pleb & take your pick from the Holy Trinity of Religious Excuses:

> You don't understand it
>
> Out of Context!™
>
> You need faith to understand!
>
> You see, the original meaning in Hebrew/Greek/whatever culture is..." **
   
Remember, these quotes are products of their times. Critically evaluate their impact on equality and dignity while considering their historical context.

## Modern State of Casteism
The whole caste system deal in India is like a loop-de-loop roller coaster in present state. People's beliefs and what they do because of them keep bouncing off each other, making the system even stronger. Think of it like a cycle where how people see things shapes what they do, and what they do then affects how they see things. It's everywhere in society: Social media trends shape what we buy, and what we buy influences the next social media trends. People's increasing fear of a neighborhood being unsafe leads to fewer people going out, making the area seem even more dangerous. People's fear of a bank collapse leading them to withdraw their money, causing the bank's actual collapse. People's fear of a financial crisis leads them to hoard money, causing a decrease in spending and further worsening the crisis. When people panic and start selling stocks during a market crash, their actions can actually trigger more panic and worsen the crash & so on.

Back in the day, Hindu culture put a "made with religious beliefs" stamp on it. Stories, traditions, and holy texts justified this system that gave different roles to different groups. Those ideas had a backstage pass to social and economic decisions, like pushing some folks to the side and treating them differently. Those actions then pumped up the beliefs even more! The way people treated each other reinforced those cultural ideas. This whole loopity-loop thing has made the caste system unbreakable, even though some folks tried to change it. Even when they brought in policies to help lower castes, it added more twists to the ride. Those perks made people show off their caste labels even more, and some people felt left out and ticked off. So the cycle spun on, making things more complicated than it was originally intended.
