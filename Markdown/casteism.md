## The Complex Puzzle of India's Caste System

India's tapestry weaves together casteism, poverty, and cultural norms that often baffle outsiders. The government juggles socialist and nationalist agendas, while religious dynamics add irony and conflict. Pollution runs rampant, bureaucracy is a monumental challenge, and the streets teem with rickshaws, dogs, and cows. Potholes could swallow a truck, the heat is intense, and the wealth gap is glaring.

Speaking of casteism, it's a lot more intricate than it looks. Alongside the traditional caste hierarchy, the concept of Dalits, or untouchables, exists. Aryan influence has twisted perceptions, creating an unjust system where some are treated as subhuman. Oddly, equality depends on this very casteism, as the government established the system to offer equal opportunities to lower castes.

This is a political playground now, with groups exploiting their own and others capitalizing on the situation. Caste roles blur in modern India. Brahmins might live simply while Dalits prosper. The caste system has divorced from its original meaning and become a political tool. As a Brahmin, I have no special rights over Dalits today. It's a bit like the US, where movements like LGBTQ+ and Black Lives Matter challenge power dynamics. BJP affiliation that I got after some emotional manipulation from local BJP workers is mainly for show, and it's handy for road rage incidents. Politics here is more circus than substance. Authenticity takes a back seat to crowd-pleasing tactics.

Actually, India's caste system is this colossal puzzle with dfferent theories. First, the traditional one says it's divine sorting: Brahmins from the mouth, Kshatriyas from the arms, Vaishyas from the thighs, and Shudras from the feet of a god named Brahma. Then there's the racial theory. It's like an Aryan club where fair-skinned Aryans led and others were demoted. The political angle, rulers played the caste card for power. How? Reservations? Now upper castes have EWS reservations, lower class, woman, practically everyone has a class. If there's none, then you still have a class - "no class" class. Yes, that's a class and you will be discriminated accordingly. With EWS, UR team is basically now "Can't beat them, join them" party. The occupational theory turned job titles into classes. Brahmins led, Kshatriyas defended, Vaishyas traded, and Shudras labored. But no theory's golden. The caste system's a cube with a million sides. Theories are bits of the solution. It's complex, mixing history, culture, religion, politics, economy, and human nature.

Hence I have following suggestions for improvement of our racist culture:

1. Generalize but don't discriminate based on superficial backgrounds that one has no control over.
2.  Don't engage in any extremist views or policies that violates basic human rights including the right to life, liberty, and security of person; the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion; the right to freedom of expression; the right to assembly and association; the right to work and to just and favorable conditions of work; the right to social security; the right to education; and the right to participate in the government of one's country. If you want to judge, judge yourself your own beliefs. Be your own racist.
