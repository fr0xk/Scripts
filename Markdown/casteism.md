## The Complex Puzzle of India's Caste System

India's tapestry weaves together casteism, poverty, and cultural norms that often baffle outsiders. The government juggles socialist and nationalist agendas, while religious dynamics add irony and conflict. Pollution runs rampant, bureaucracy is a monumental challenge, and the streets teem with rickshaws, dogs, and cows. Potholes could swallow a truck, the heat is intense, and the wealth gap is glaring.

Speaking of casteism, it's a lot more intricate than it looks. Alongside the traditional caste hierarchy, the concept of Dalits, or untouchables, exists. Aryan influence has twisted perceptions, creating an unjust system where some are treated as subhuman. Oddly, equality depends on this very casteism, as the government established the system to offer equal opportunities to lower castes.

This is a political playground now, with groups exploiting their own and others capitalizing on the situation. Caste roles blur in modern India. Brahmins might live simply while Dalits prosper. The caste system has divorced from its original meaning and become a political tool. As a Brahmin, I have no special rights over Dalits today. It's a bit like the US, where movements like LGBTQ+ and Black Lives Matter challenge power dynamics. BJP affiliation that I got after some emotional manipulation from local BJP workers is mainly for show, and it's handy for road rage incidents. Politics here is more circus than substance. Authenticity takes a back seat to crowd-pleasing tactics.

Actually, India's caste system is this colossal puzzle with dfferent theories. First, the traditional one says it's divine sorting: Brahmins from the mouth, Kshatriyas from the arms, Vaishyas from the thighs, and Shudras from the feet of a god named Brahma. Then there's the racial theory. It's like an Aryan club where fair-skinned Aryans led and others were demoted. The political angle, rulers played the caste card for power. How? Reservations? Now upper castes have EWS reservations, lower class, woman, practically everyone has a class. If there's none, then you still have a class - "no class" class. Yes, that's a class and you will be discriminated accordingly. With EWS, UR team is basically now "can't beat them, join them" gang. The occupational theory turned job titles into classes. Brahmins led, Kshatriyas defended, Vaishyas traded, and Shudras labored. But no theory's golden. The caste system's a cube with a million sides. Theories are bits of the solution. It's complex, mixing history, culture, religion, politics, economy, and human nature.

Hence I have following suggestions for improvement of our racist culture:

1. Generalize but don't discriminate based on superficial backgrounds that one has no control over.
2.  Don't engage in any extremist views or policies that violates basic human rights including the right to life, liberty, and security of person; the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion (except personal laws); the right to freedom of expression; the right to assembly and association; the right to work and to just and favorable conditions of work; the right to social security; the right to education; and the right to participate in the government of one's country. If you want to judge, judge yourself, your own beliefs. Be your own racist.

Ancient texts like the Vedas, Bible, and Quran carry spiritual messages that go beyond their literal meanings, shaped by the social contexts of their eras. They contain both oppressive and positive verses. Look beyond the surface to uncover deeper meanings.

- Vedas: "Husband is wife's highest deity; what he commands, she must do." (Rig Veda 8.33.19)
This quote implies gender inequality, contrasting with the principle of equal rights. Women should have access to education, work, health, and freedom.

- Bible: "Slaves, obey masters with respect as you obey Christ." (Ephesians 6:5)
This quote supports slavery, contradicting the ideals of freedom and justice. All humans are born free and equal in dignity.

- Quran: "Kill them where you find them...fitnah is worse than killing." (Quran 2:191)
This quote advocates violence against opponents. Peace, tolerance, and freedom of thought and religion are crucial values.

Additionally:

1. **Vedas:**
   - "Women are devoid of strength, devoid of mental energy... it is in the very nature of women to corrupt men." (Atharva Veda 6.11.3)
   
2. **Bible:**
   - "I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet." (1 Timothy 2:12)
   
3. **Quran:**
   - "Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other..." (Quran 4:34)
   
4. **Ancient Chinese Texts (Confucianism):**
   - "Let the woman follow the man. Let her remain unknown. Loving submission is the highest virtue." (The Analects of Confucius, 17.25)
   
5. **Greek Mythology:**
   - "A man's most valuable prize is a virtuous wife; his most valuable prize is a shameless one." (Hesiod's "Works and Days," 701-702)
   
6. **Renaissance Literature:**
   - "It is the nature of women to be fickle... to deceive and to rob men of their brains." (Baldassare Castiglione's "The Book of the Courtier," 1528)
   
7. **Modern Example (Misogynistic):**
   - "A good wife is one who serves her husband in the morning like a mother does, loves him during the day like a sister does, and pleases him like a prostitute at night." (Chanakya's "Arthashastra," 4th century BCE)
   
Remember, these quotes are products of their times. Critically evaluate their impact on equality and dignity while considering their historical context.

## Modern State of Casteism
The whole caste system deal in India is like a loop-de-loop roller coaster in present state. People's beliefs and what they do because of them keep bouncing off each other, making the system even stronger. Think of it like a cycle where how people see things shapes what they do, and what they do then affects how they see things. It's like reality is a big mirror reflecting actions, and those actions then tweak the reflection.

Take the caste system, for example. Back in the day, Hindu culture put a "made with religious beliefs" stamp on it. Stories, traditions, and holy texts justified this system that gave different roles to different groups. Those ideas had a backstage pass to social and economic decisions, like pushing some folks to the side and treating them differently. Those actions then pumped up the beliefs even more! The way people treated each other reinforced those cultural ideas. It was like building walls between castes, making them different not only in real stuff but also in how they thought about themselves. This whole loopity-loop thing has made the caste system unbreakable, even though some folks tried to change it. It's like a stubborn stain that just won't go away. Even when they brought in policies to help lower castes, it added more twists to the ride. Those perks made people show off their caste labels even more, and some people felt left out and ticked off. So the cycle spun on, making things more complicated than a Rubik's cube.
