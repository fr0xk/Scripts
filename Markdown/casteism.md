# Caste System in India

The caste system in India is a complex and controversial social phenomenon that has its roots in ancient history and continues to influence the lives of millions of people today. It is a system of social stratification that divides people into hierarchical groups based on their birth, occupation, religion, and other factors. The caste system has been criticized for being discriminatory, oppressive, and unjust, but it has also been defended as a source of identity, culture, and tradition. In this article, we will explore the origin, features, problems, and reforms of the caste system in India.

## Origin of the caste system

The origin of the caste system in India is not clear, as there are different theories that try to explain how and when it emerged. Some of the main theories are:

- **The traditional theory**: This theory is based on the Hindu scriptures, especially the **Purushasukta** of **Rigveda** and the **Manusmriti**. It claims that the caste system is of divine origin and that the four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras) originated from the body parts of **Brahma**, the creator god. The Brahmins were made from his mouth, the Kshatriyas from his arms, the Vaishyas from his thighs, and the Shudras from his feet. The sub-castes (jatis) emerged later due to intermarriages between the varnas. This theory is supported by some orthodox Hindus who believe in the authority and infallibility of the Vedas¹².

- **The racial theory**: This theory is based on the assumption that the caste system reflects the racial differences between the **Aryans** and the **non-Aryans** (Dasa) who inhabited India in ancient times. It suggests that the Aryans, who had fair skin, came from northern Asia and southern Europe and invaded India around 1500 BCE. They subdued and enslaved the indigenous people, who had dark skin, and imposed their social hierarchy on them. The Aryans became the upper castes, while the non-Aryans became the lower castes. This theory was popularized by some British colonial scholars and administrators who used it to justify their rule over India¹³⁴.

- **The political theory**: This theory argues that the caste system was a result of the political and economic changes that occurred in India during the medieval period, especially under the **Mughal Empire** and the **British Raj**. It states that the caste system was not a rigid or static phenomenon, but a dynamic and flexible one that adapted to the changing circumstances and interests of various groups. The rulers, both foreign and native, manipulated and exploited the caste system to maintain their power and control over the masses. They also created new castes and sub-castes to reward or punish their allies or enemies. The caste system became more complex and hierarchical as a result of these interventions¹.

- **The occupational theory**: This theory maintains that the caste system was based on the division of labour and occupation in ancient India. It posits that people were initially classified into four broad categories according to their functions in society: priests (Brahmins), warriors (Kshatriyas), traders (Vaishyas) and workers (Shudras). These categories were not hereditary or fixed, but flexible and fluid. People could change their occupation and status according to their merit and ability. However, over time, these categories became more rigid and inherited, as people started to associate their occupation with their identity and prestige. The occupational theory is supported by some modern sociologists who view caste as a form of social stratification².

- **The evolutionary theory**: This theory suggests that the caste system evolved gradually over a long period of time as a response to the environmental, cultural and historical factors that shaped Indian society. It asserts that there was no single or uniform caste system in India, but multiple and diverse systems that varied from region to region and from period to period. The caste system was not imposed by any external force or authority, but developed organically from within as a way of organizing and regulating social relations among different groups. The evolutionary theory is favored by some historians who emphasize the diversity and complexity of Indian civilization⁵.

These are some of the major theories that attempt to explain the origin of the caste system in India. However, none of them can provide a definitive or comprehensive answer to this question, as they all have their own strengths and weaknesses, biases and limitations. The caste system is a multifaceted phenomenon that cannot be reduced to a single cause or factor. It is a product of history, culture, religion, politics, economy, ecology and psychology.

## Features of the caste system

The caste system in India has some distinctive features that distinguish it from other forms of social classification. Some of these features are:

- **Endogamy**: Endogamy is the practice of marrying within one's own caste or sub-caste. It is one of the most important rules of the caste system, as it preserves the purity and identity of each group. Violating this rule can result in social ostracism, violence, or even death. Endogamy also reinforces the boundaries and differences between castes, as it prevents intermixing and assimilation⁶.

- **Hierarchy**: Hierarchy is the ranking of castes according to their status, prestige, and power. It is based on various criteria, such as birth, occupation, education, wealth, ritual purity, and social behavior. The hierarchy is not fixed or uniform, but varies from place to place and time to time. Generally, the Brahmins are considered the highest caste, followed by the Kshatriyas, the Vaishyas, and the Shudras. Below the Shudras are the **Dalits** (formerly known as untouchables), who are considered outside the varna system and subjected to extreme discrimination and oppression.

- **Hereditary**: Hereditary means that one's caste is determined by birth and cannot be changed. It is based on the concept of **karma**, which is the law of cause and effect that governs one's actions and their consequences. According to this concept, one's caste is a result of one's deeds in previous lives. Therefore, one has to accept one's caste as a fate and perform one's duties accordingly. Changing one's caste is considered a sin and a violation of the natural order.

- **Occupation**: Occupation is the main function or profession that one performs in society. It is closely linked to one's caste, as each caste has its own traditional or assigned occupations. For example, the Brahmins are supposed to be priests, teachers, and scholars; the Kshatriyas are supposed to be warriors, rulers, and administrators; the Vaishyas are supposed to be traders, farmers, and artisans; and the Shudras are supposed to be servants, laborers, and craftsmen. The Dalits are supposed to do the most menial and impure jobs, such as cleaning, scavenging, skinning animals, and handling corpses.

- **Ritual purity**: Ritual purity is the degree of cleanliness or holiness that one possesses according to Hindu religious norms. It is influenced by one's caste, occupation, food habits, personal hygiene, and social interactions. The higher castes are considered more pure than the lower castes, as they follow stricter rules of purity and avoid contact with impure substances or people. The Dalits are considered the most impure and polluting group, as they deal with dirt, blood, flesh, and death. Ritual purity also affects one's access to temples, wells, schools, public places, and other resources.

These are some of the main features of the caste system in India that define and regulate the social life of its members. However, these features are not static or uniform, but dynamic and diverse. They change according to time, place, context, and agency.
