Unix shell scripting skills can be transferred and used in C++ and Python as both languages have their own command-line interfaces and can execute shell commands. Shell scripting skills can also help in developing good coding practices, such as modularizing code and automating repetitive tasks.

Here's an example of how Unix shell scripting skills can be used in C++:

Suppose you have a directory of text files, and you want to count the number of lines in each file and output the result to a separate file. You could use the following shell command:

```wc -l *.txt > line_counts.txt```


This command uses the `wc` command to count the number of lines in each file with a `.txt` extension and outputs the result to a file named `line_counts.txt`.

To achieve the same result in C++, you could write a program that uses the `std::ifstream` class to open each file, read the lines, and count them, and then output the result to a file using the `std::ofstream` class. However, this would require writing a lot of boilerplate code.

Alternatively, you could use the `system` function in C++ to execute the shell command and capture the output. Here's an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

int main() {
    std::string command = "wc -l *.txt > line_counts.txt";
    int result = system(command.c_str());
    if (result != 0) {
        std::cerr << "Command failed with exit code " << result << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This program uses the system function to execute the same shell command as before. If the command succeeds, system returns zero. If the command fails, it returns a non-zero value, which we can capture and handle in the program.

Here's an example of how Unix shell scripting skills can be used in Python:

Suppose you have a directory of CSV files, and you want to combine them into a single file. You could use the following shell command:

```cat *.csv > combined.csv```

This command uses the cat command to concatenate all files with a .csv extension and output the result to a file named combined.csv.

To achieve the same result in Python, you could write a program that opens each file, reads its contents, and writes them to a single output file. However, this would require a lot of boilerplate code.

Alternatively, you could use the subprocess module in Python to execute the shell command and capture the output. Here's an example:

```
import subprocess

command = "cat *.csv > combined.csv"
result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True)
if result.returncode != 0:
    print(f"Command failed with exit code {result.returncode}")
```
We can also use Unix shell scripting skills to automate tasks in Python. For example, suppose we want to download all the PDF files from a website. We could use the wget command in a shell script to download all the PDFs, and then use the subprocess module in Python to execute the shell script. Here's an example:

```#!/bin/bash
wget -r -np -A.pdf https://example.com/
```

This shell script uses the wget command with the options -r (recursive), -np (no parent), and -A.pdf (only download files with a .pdf extension) to download all the PDF files from the website https://example.com/.

We can then use the subprocess module in Python to execute the shell script:

```
import subprocess

command = "./download_pdfs.sh"
result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True)
if result.returncode != 0:
    print(f"Command failed with exit code {result.returncode}")
```

This Python program uses the subprocess.run function to execute the shell script download_pdfs.sh. If the command succeeds, subprocess.run returns a CompletedProcess object with a returncode attribute of zero. If the command fails, it returns a CompletedProcess object with a non-zero returncode, which we can capture and handle in the program.
