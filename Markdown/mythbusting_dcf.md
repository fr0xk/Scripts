# DCF == PE

## YES

This is a repository for demonstrating the equivalence of discounted cash flow (DCF) and price-to-earnings (PE) ratio valuation method. People criticize PE ratios due to margin mean reversion. They say that present earnings are not a reliable metric for future cash flows. That's true but only if you pick a handful of companies. But over a large sample size, DCF and PE are basically the same thing. You pay as low as possible to present cash flows so that you get future cash flows at a cheap rate.

## Example

Let's examine an example to demonstrate the concept. Consider two companies, Company A and Company B, operating within the technology sector (industry specificity is important). Company A possesses a modest PE ratio of 10, indicating that its stock price is relatively lower in comparison to its earnings. Moreover, it boasts a substantial profit margin of 20%, signifying its capability to generate significant profits from its sales. In contrast, Company B exhibits a high PE ratio of 30, implying that its stock price is relatively higher in relation to its earnings when its profit margin stands at a mere 5%, indicating lower profitability. These are just hypothetical examples.

| Company | PE Ratio | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| A       | 10       | 20%           |
| B       | 30       | 5%            |

The underlying rationale for this approach is derived from CAPM, which suggests that companies with higher profit margins should be associated with lower PE ratios, while companies with lower profit margins should be tied to higher PE ratios¹. So market just does it. By diligently adhering to this principle, I believe it's possible to outperform approximately 90% of actively managed portfolios.

## Methodology

The DCF model refers to a group of approaches that assume the value of an asset equals the present value of all future monetary benefits². This model is easy to use when the future cash benefits are known or can be at least reasonably forecasted. The most common variations of the DCF model are the dividend discount model (DDM) and the free cash flow (FCF) model².

The comparables method uses ratios from an industry, peer group or similar companies to estimate a company’s equity value². The following ratios are mostly used: price-to-earning ratio (P/E), price-to-sales ratio (P/S), and enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EV/EBITDA), which are also called multiples².

The prevailing concept behind the comparable method is the law of one price, which states that similar assets should sell at a similar price². We can rephrase this for company earnings or profit: Companies that have similar revenues and earnings drivers should be worth about the same.

## Strategy

Keep in mind that employing this strategy necessitates a substantial sample size to yield dependable outcomes. By consistently implementing such an approach, investors may enhance their chances of achieving favorable investment results. Basically it involves purchasing stocks with high PE ratios and low profit margins in one industry, and stocks with low PE ratios and high profit margins in other industries. Additionally I propose considering the EV/Revenue ratio. A ratio exceeding 4 raises questions about the viability of an investment.
