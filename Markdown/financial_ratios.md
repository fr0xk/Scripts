# A Brief History of Financial Ratios

Financial ratios are numerical values derived from a company's financial statements that provide meaningful information about its liquidity, leverage, efficiency, profitability, and valuation. Financial ratios have a long history that dates back to ancient times, when people used accounting methods to record transactions involving goods and services. 

Some of the earliest financial ratios were presented by **Euclid** in his book 5, ‘Elements’ in about **300 B.C.** However, at that time, ratio was not used as a financial tool. 

The first time financial statement analysis was done by American industries was in the **Nineteenth Century** to compare financial results for different purposes. 

Some of the common financial ratios that are used today, such as **revenue**, **net income**, **earnings per share**, etc., were developed in the **Twentieth Century** as accounting standards and financial reporting became more sophisticated and widespread. 

One of the latest financial ratios that has gained popularity is **adjusted EBITDA**, which stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for certain non-recurring or non-cash items. This ratio is often used by investors and analysts to measure the operating performance and cash flow generation of a company. 

The following table shows some of the financial ratios and their approximate time of invention, along with the name of the inventor or popularizer of the metric, if known.
