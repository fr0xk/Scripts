# The Importance of Moral Values

Personally, I think being a good person boils down to being kind, understanding, and honest. You should treat others with respect and fairness, and own up to your mistakes. These qualities are the building blocks of a society that works for everyone. But some people will still disagree. They'll say, "What about those who prey on people's fears and weaknesses, like fake fortune tellers, corrupt politicians, and shady businesspeople?" They'll also point out that the internet is full of misinformation meant to deceive and manipulate. "How can we separate fact from fiction? How can I be sure I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid myself? How can we promote honesty and trust when leaders use divisive language instead of taking responsibility for their actions?" They'll also wonder, "If everyone else is looking out for these same powerful people, why should I bother being kind and honest? It seems like a losing game. Maybe I should just join the ranks of the powerful and wealthy and do whatever it takes to get ahead."

So what are the consequences of a society without clear moral values?

When a society's moral fabric unravels, people get blind to the their own state, even with their eyes wide open. They'll be lost in a sea of confusion, fall for the things like "tu quoque" fallacy, unable to tell right from wrong. Everyone will be caught up in a dog-eat-dog world where only the strongest and fittest survive. In this ruthless landscape, being "strong & fit" means doing whatever it takes to come out on top, even if it means throwing others under the bus or selling your own soul. People will lost control access to their critical thinking. If you treat every personal experience as the definitive representation of societal reality and equate it with objective truth, you risk adopting a biased perspective such as racism, phobism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination.
