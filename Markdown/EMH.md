# Interpretation of Efficient Market Hypothesis and the Role of Technical Analysis & Value Investing 

## Introduction:

This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and its implications, specifically examining the role of technical analysis. The EMH, as proposed by Eugene Fama, posits that markets are efficient and stock prices reflect all relevant information. However, the effectiveness of technical analysis within the framework of the EMH remains a subject of debate.

## Efficient Market Hypothesis and Fama's Perspective:

Fama's views on the EMH clarify common misconceptions. Contrary to popular belief, he does not argue that outperforming the market is impossible. Instead, he contends that such outperformance often involves assuming higher levels of risk, relying on uncertainty and fear rather than stability and trust. Fama emphasizes the significance of evaluating different risk dimensions and expected returns in investment decisions, rather than fixating on stock selection or manager choices.

Fama's definition of the EMH rests on the assumption that all relevant information is readily accessible to all investors, enabling stock prices to consistently reflect their fair market value. He maintains that security prices fully incorporate all available information. Fama also distinguishes between the weak and strong forms of the EMH, with the weak form assuming that past information is already reflected in stock prices, while new, non-public information may not be accounted for. The weak form further suggests that technical trading strategies are unlikely to consistently generate excess returns due to their limited ability to predict future prices based solely on past performance.

## The Efficient Market Hypothesis: Common Misinterpretations and What It Really Means

The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) is one of the most influential and controversial ideas in financial economics. It states that asset prices reflect all available information, and that it is impossible to beat the market consistently on a risk-adjusted basis. The EMH has important implications for investors, regulators, and academics, but it is also often misunderstood and misapplied. In this article, we will clarify some common misinterpretations of the EMH and explain what it really means.

**Misinterpretation 1: The EMH implies that markets are always right**

One of the most common misinterpretations of the EMH is that it implies that markets are always right, that is, that asset prices always equal their true or intrinsic values. This is not what the EMH says. The EMH only says that asset prices reflect all available information, but this information may be incomplete, inaccurate, or biased. Moreover, the EMH does not specify how investors process information or form expectations about future events. Different investors may have different opinions, beliefs, or preferences that affect their valuation of assets. Therefore, the EMH does not rule out the possibility that asset prices may deviate from their true values due to irrationality, noise, or behavioral biases.

**Misinterpretation 2: The EMH implies that markets are unpredictable**

Another common misinterpretation of the EMH is that it implies that markets are unpredictable, that is, that asset prices follow a random walk and cannot be forecasted. This is also not what the EMH says. The EMH only says that asset prices reflect all available information, but this information may change over time due to new events or discoveries. Therefore, the EMH does not rule out the possibility that asset prices may exhibit patterns or trends due to changes in fundamentals, expectations, or risk premiums. However, the EMH does imply that any predictable patterns or trends in asset prices should be consistent with risk and return trade-offs, and that any excess returns from exploiting them should be offset by higher risk or lower liquidity.

**Misinterpretation 3: The EMH implies that active investing is futile**

A third common misinterpretation of the EMH is that it implies that active investing is futile, that is, that investors cannot outperform the market by using fundamental analysis, technical analysis, or market timing. This is also not what the EMH says. The EMH only says that asset prices reflect all available information, but this information may not be equally accessible or interpretable by all investors. Therefore, the EMH does not rule out the possibility that some investors may have an informational advantage over others due to superior research, analysis, or intuition. However, the EMH does imply that any informational advantage should be temporary and hard to sustain, and that any excess returns from exploiting it should be eroded by competition or regulation.

**What the EMH really means**

The EMH is not a statement about how markets work in reality, but rather a benchmark for how markets should work in an ideal world. It is a hypothesis that can be tested empirically by comparing actual market outcomes with theoretical predictions based on different models of risk and return. The EMH does not deny the existence of market anomalies, inefficiencies, or bubbles, but rather challenges us to explain them using rigorous and consistent frameworks. The EMH does not discourage active investing, but rather encourages us to evaluate its costs and benefits using realistic and relevant measures of performance.

The EMH was originally proposed by Eugene Fama in his seminal 1970 paper "Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work". Fama defined three forms of market efficiency: weak-form (prices reflect past information), semi-strong-form (prices reflect public information), and strong-form (prices reflect private information). He reviewed the existing evidence on each form and concluded that markets were mostly efficient in the weak-form and semi-strong-form, but less so in the strong-form. He also acknowledged the limitations and challenges of testing market efficiency empirically.

Since then, the EMH has been refined and extended by many researchers and practitioners in financial economics. The EMH has also faced many criticisms and controversies from various perspectives and disciplines. The debate over market efficiency is still ongoing and lively today.

The main takeaway from this article is that the EMH is not a dogma or a doctrine, but rather a hypothesis or a theory. It is not a simple or a static idea, but rather a complex and a dynamic one. It is not a universal or a absolute truth, but rather a conditional and a relative one. It is not a final or a definitive answer, but rather a starting point and a guiding principle.

## Expected Returns and Delusion of Positive Sum

Investment returns have two parts: the expected return and the unexpected return. The expected return is the best guess of what will happen based on all the information currently available. The unexpected return is the surprise, the difference between what does happen and what was expected. Investors should base their portfolio decisions on expected future returns, not recent realized returns, and the two can differ by a lot. Look at the returns on the so-called FAANG. Given their great returns over the last 10 years, what is our best guess of how the FAANG stocks will do over the next decade? Should we expect an average annual return of almost 35% again? Absolutely not. Who wouldn’t buy these stocks if their expected returns were 35%? But buyers need sellers. The demand driven by such high expected returns would simply push prices up and drive expected returns down to a more reasonable level. For the same reason, I’m confident that if we could go back to August 2010, we would find few investors predicting the FAANG stocks would do as well as they did from 2010 to 2020. So what does explain the FAANG stocks’ high realized returns? Their unexpected returns. Things turned out much better for them than investors expected. The companies’ cash flows over the last 10 years were much higher than investors expected 10 years ago and their prospects looking forward from today are almost certainly better than investors expected they would be 10 years ago.

All this unexpected good news produced high unexpected stock returns over the last decade. It would be wrong, however, to expect high unexpected returns to persist. After all, it doesn’t make sense to count on good luck. The expected value of the unexpected returns must be zero.

## The Role of Value Investing:

> Any Investing is Value Investing - Warren Buffett
>
- Person 1: Value investing is a strategy of buying stocks of companies that have strong fundamentals and competitive advantages, but are undervalued by the market.

- Person 2: So it's like bargain hunting cheap stocks?

- Person 1: No, it's not bargain hunting. It's a way of finding quality businesses that are worth more than their current price.

- Person 2: But how can you tell if a company is worth more than its price? That sounds subjective to me.

- Person 1: Well, it's not subjective. It's based on analyzing the company's financial statements, growth prospects, competitive position and intrinsic value.

- Person 2: But how do you calculate the intrinsic value? How do you factor in all the uncertainties and risks?

- Person 1: You calculate the intrinsic value by estimating the future cash flows that the company can generate and discounting them to the present. This process is called valuation.

- Person 2: Valuation? So you just make up numbers and hope for the best?

- Person 1: No, you don't make up numbers. You use realistic assumptions and conservative estimates based on the available information.

- Person 2: Sounds like a lot of guesswork and speculation to me. Why don't you just buy index funds or a bunch of cheap stocks like everyone else?

- Person 1: You don't understand Value Investing. Go away and read 10000 pages of "Berkshire Hathaway" annual shareholder's letter.

- Person 2: I did read it. He said "Any Investing is Value Investing".

The term "Value Investing" is often misused, hyped or marketed to describe different approaches to investing that may or may not rely on speculation. I prefer to use the original term that Benjamin Graham coined, which is also consistent with the academic definition of value stocks: "cheap stocks". This means that we should evaluate stocks based on their current price relative to some fundamental measure of value, such as earnings or book value. Growth and quality are not relevant for value investing, as they are sources of uncertainty and speculation.

If what Warren Buffett above quoted is true, then Value Investing is is buying a company or an asset at less than it's worth. The problem is "intrinsic worth" is not objective, observable fact, but merely an educated judgement based on investor psychology (optimism or pessimism). There will be endless debate and endless cycle of expansion and contraction due to this disagreement with ever changing value premium. In a systematic view, when risk premiums are on the side of positive outcome, it can be a potential Value Investing opportunity.

To some extent if you believe that individuals employ various strategies when trading in markets, which can involve relying on tips, succumbing to short-term greed, or looking at past prices to create a a weak form of market. But when considering the larger group of participants of today's developed & developing countries and amount of information circulating via various sources, any form of opportunities created through irrational behavior is ultimately eliminated through competition among them (rationality vs irrational participants)

Furthermore, the concept of risk is highly subjective. Risk can manifest as volatility according to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), or it can be associated with business risk, liquidity risk, or solvency risk. In the realm of Value Investing, a higher discount is demanded compared to the market in order to compensate for these risks. Otherwise, the whole exercise would be pointless. And if we assume the statement "most fund managers can't beat the benchmark" is true, then neither group should be able to predict cash flows better than the market itself over time. Whether they invest in "Great companies at reasonable prices" or "Bad companies at cheap prices". Eugene Fama, however, favors the later. The concept behind value stocks is that they have low prices compared to their current financial situation, so the market views them as being in some financial trouble. The value premium refers to the difference in returns between stocks with low market values compared to their book value, earnings, or cash flow (these are called value stocks) and stocks with high market values relative to these measures (these are called growth stocks). Value stocks often face difficulties, such as low profitability and high debt. The value premium is the extra return investors expect to receive for taking on the risk that these companies may perform poorly or even go out of business. In a semi-efficient market, price can also represent value. When all relevant information is accessible, market participants engage in collective fundamental analysis to determine a fair price for a security, considering all available data. The value premium (margin of safety) refers to the additional compensation that value investors demand for assuming additional risk

>"The idea is that value stocks have low prices relative to their present fundamentals, so the market thinks they're relatively financially distressed. The value premium is the return difference between stocks with low market values relative to book value, earnings, or cash flow (value stocks) and stocks with high market values relative to these measures (growth stocks). Value stocks are often distressed, in the sense that they have low profitability and high leverage. The value premium is compensation for bearing the risk that these firms do poorly or fail."

**Systematic Value vs Discretionary Judgement**

The terms "quantitative," "systematic," and "rules-based" are often used interchangeably and seen as the opposite of a "fundamental," "discretionary," or "stock-picking" approach to investing. Systematic and discretionary approaches are not complete opposites. Both types of managers have the same goal and can focus on fundamental factors, but they use different methods to improve investment performance. Neither systematic nor discretionary managers are inherently better, as both approaches can lead to positive investment outcomes. There is limited evidence suggesting that one approach is superior to the other. Historical correlations between excess returns from systematic and discretionary managers are low, which means that including both types of managers in investment allocations could benefit many investors. It's also evident that historical correlations among systematic investors are as low as those among discretionary investors, indicating that the belief that "all quants trade on the same signals" is incorrect.

The first concept we need to understand is the forward PE ratio, which represents the price-to-earnings ratio that is expected but not yet announced. It is essentially a speculative or educated guess based on hypotheses. Forward PE is not an observable fact, and therefore we cannot engage in debates regarding hypothetical cash flows. You can say X and I can say Y and guess what? We're both equally correct. I'm not trying to alter the definition of PE ratios where E still stands for earnings instead of elephants. But I think it's often misunderstood as "DCF > PE". PE is a misleading measure if current earnings don't reflect long-term future cash flows. But if they do, then PE is a proper measure. (In ideal situation, profit margin also needs to be considered, where lower PE should correspond to higher margin and vice versa).

PE is a statistical measure, which means it requires a large sample size to work. This implies that if the market is somewhat efficient, holding a diversified portfolio of low PE stocks for 30+ years will yield similar returns to carefully selected stocks by investors who build a concentrated portfolio

Consider a hypothetical scenario with a stock that has historical earnings per share (EPS) values of 10, 10.5, 10, 11, 12, and 13. The current price of the stock is 750. Now, let's assume that you believe there are macroeconomic or product demand reasons that could lead to an EPS of 50 in the near future, resulting in a forward PE ratio of only 15. In this case, you could be correct, which would signify a significant shift from the present situation or even if you turn out to be wrong, there may still be other factors influencing the stock price that could lead to financial gains on your side or worse you will be bagholding.

Now, let's consider a scenario where you select 150 stocks using discretionary judgment, either based on analyst estimates (which often tend to be overshoot or undershoot) or your own assessment within a semi-efficient market. On the other hand, another individual chooses 150 stocks based solely on the lowest 10% of price-to-earnings or price-to-book ratios within each sector, without considering any other factors such as management or qualitative aspects.

Both of you hold these stocks for a long period, let's say 30 years. In a semi-efficient market, any additional effort exerted through discretionary judgment should have minimal impact, and any alpha generated through discretionary decision-making is likely to be accounted for in terms of time, costs, and associated risks associated with it. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether valuation derived from discretionary judgment, based on cash flow estimates, can generate alpha (excess returns) compared to systematically selected stocks based on academic factors such as price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios.

Valuing assets or companies is not just challenging—it's actually impossible. That's why even Ben Graham, widely regarded as the father of value investing, didn't use the term "value" himself. Instead, he referred to them as "cheap stocks." Cheap stocks typically represent poorly performing companies that investors believe are more valuable when bankrupt than when operational. These stocks are often defined academically as having low prices relative to their current financial indicators.

If the market is truly efficient and always correct, then all cheap stocks will continue to decrease in value. However, if the market is only partially efficient, there is a possibility of a positive outcome when investing in a collection of such cheap stocks throughout a complete business cycle. Based on my standpoint, I believe that neither systematic nor discretionary decisions can consistently generate excess returns over the other.

## The Role of Technical Analysis:

Despite Fama's reservations about the effectiveness of technical analysis within the EMH, it is essential to explore its potential merits. Technical analysis involves identifying recurring patterns and trends in price movements. If technical analysis is defined as a statistical analysis of such patterns, it aligns with Fama's probabilistic viewpoint.

We need to differentiate technical analysis based on recurring patterns from approaches that rely purely on chance or randomness. Fama's skepticism towards technical analysis pertains to the latter interpretation, where outcomes with equal probabilities would be incongruous with the EMH.

Nevertheless, there is evidence to suggest that technical analysis, when combined with prudent risk management and disciplined execution, can yield positive outcomes. By leveraging historical price data, indicators, and chart patterns, traders can develop trading systems that exploit market inefficiencies and potentially generate consistent returns.

## Quantitative Explanation:

>"It is a great mistake to believe that a speculation has been unwise if you lose money at it. That sounds like an obvious conclusion, but actually it is not true at all. A speculation is unwise only if it is made on insufficient study and by poor judgment. There is a great deal of that in Wall Street, particularly in the field of speculation, when you are trying to do it by careful calculation. In some cases the thing will work out badly. But that is simply part of the game. If the probabilities, as measure by our mathematical test, are definitely in favor of the speculation, then we can transform these separate intelligent speculations into investment by the simple device of diversification. That, I think, is a clue to the most successful and rewarding treatment of speculation in Wall Street. The idea, in fine, is simply to get the odds on your side by processes of skillful, experienced calculation. If it was bound to work out rightly, it wouldn’t be a speculation at all, and there wouldn’t be the opportunities of profit that inhere in sound speculation. It seems to me that is axiomatic."

-- Ben Graham 

To illustrate the potential outcomes of a trading strategy with a 20% win rate and a risk-reward ratio of 1:6, we conducted a quantitative analysis. Utilizing the formula for expected outcome, we calculated the expected result over a substantial number of iterations.

Expected Outcome = [(Win Probability * Reward) + (Loss Probability * Risk)] * Number of Iterations

In this instance, the win probability stands at 20% (0.20), the reward at 6, the loss probability at 80% (0.80), and the risk at 1. By substituting these values into the formula, the expected outcome can be determined:

Expected Outcome = 

[(0.20 * 6) + (0.80 * -1)] * 10,000

Expected Outcome = [1.2 + (-0.8)] * 10,000

Expected Outcome = 0.4 * 10,000

Expected Outcome = 4,000

Thus, after conducting 10,000 iterations, a trading strategy with a 20% win rate and a risk-reward ratio of 1:6 would yield an expected outcome of 4,000 units which is positive. This is what Ben Graham in his interview considered as ["intelligent speculation"](https://www.wiley.com/legacy/products/subject/finance/bgraham/benlec10.html)

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, Fama's Efficient Market Hypothesis posits that markets operate efficiently, with stock prices reflecting all pertinent information. This information is not inherently accurate, and market participants can react differently to the same information at different times. Both the Efficient Market Hypothesis and Behavioral Economics share a middle ground, acknowledging that markets are not flawlessly efficient, but rather exhibit varying degrees of efficiency influenced by factors such as the nature and availability of information, the diversity and number of participants, the level of competition and regulation, and the presence and magnitude of behavioral biases. For instance, certain markets may excel in swiftly incorporating public information like earnings reports or macroeconomic news, while others may struggle to reflect private information, such as insider trading or analyst recommendations. Similarly, some markets may be susceptible to behavioral anomalies such as overconfidence, loss aversion, or herd mentality, whereas others may be more resistant to these effects due to opportunities for arbitrage or institutional constraints. Consequently, efficiency should not be seen as a binary concept, but rather as a continuum that relies on a multitude of factors and can evolve over time.
