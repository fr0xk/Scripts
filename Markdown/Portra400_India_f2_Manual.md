**Mastering Portra 400 at f/2 with Canon AE-1 in India**

Shoot Portra 400 film at f/2 for vibrant images in Indian light.

**Quick Tips:**

* **Sunny Season (5500K-5800K):** Use 1/1000 or 1/2000 at f/2 or an ND filter for vibrant colors.

* **Golden Hour (5000K-5500K):** Shoot at f/2 with 1/125 to 1/250 for sunrise and sunset.

* **Monsoon Moods (6500K-7500K):** Try 1/60 or 1/30 at f/2 for rainy scenes.

* **Hill Station Whispers (5500K-6000K):** Adjust to 1/125 at f/2 for cooler climates.

**Beyond landscapes:**

* **Freeze Time:** Capture dynamic moments at f/2, e.g., 1/500 for festivals or 1/1000 for playful scenes.

* **Dreamy Portraits:** Soften details with 1/60 or 1/30 at f/2.
  
* **Indoors:** Adapt to the low light environment by setting white balance to 3200K for LEDs, 3500-4000K for halogens, and adjusting shutter speed to 1/60-1/125 for LEDs and 1/125-1/250 for halogens, utilizing a light meter for precise adjustments.

**Pro Tips:**

* **Portra 400 loves overexposure:** Opt for a faster shutter speed when in doubt.
* **Light meter is your buddy:** Trust it for tricky lighting.
* **Embrace the unexpected:** Experiment with settings.
* **Bonus Tip:** Use a lens hood to avoid flare.
