I've created a shell script to automatically handle dependencies in slackware. It's not perfect but gets the job done. He's the script 

```bash

Here's how the script would behave for installing and removing `python3` and `gcc`, including realistic examples of output for these operations.

### Example for Installing Packages

```sh
./install_packages.sh install python3 gcc
