Alice: Yo yo yo, what's up everyone, welcome to the Stock Picker Showdown, where we roast three different investment strategies and see who sucks the most. Today we have Bob, who is a classic value investor, Carol, who is a wonderful companies at fair price investor, and Dave, who is a growth investor. Let's start with Bob. Bob, why do you think value investing is the shit?

Bob: Well, Alice, it's simple. Value investing is based on the idea that the market often fucks up and prices stocks wrong, and that by buying stocks with low price-to-book or earnings ratios, you can cash in on the market's stupidity and make mad money. This strategy has been proven by many badass investors, such as Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, and Joel Greenblatt. Value investing is the only smart way to invest in the stock market.

Carol: Oh please, Bob, don't make me puke. Value investing is dead. It's a fossil of the past that doesn't work in today's crazy and competitive world. You're just buying cheap crap that nobody else wants. You're falling into value traps, where you think you're getting a deal, but you're actually buying a dying business that will never bounce back. You're missing out on the real opportunities in the market, which are the awesome companies that have killer competitive advantages, strong growth prospects, and loyal customers. These are the companies that will make you rich over time. That's why I follow the wonderful companies at fair price strategy, which was made famous by Charlie Munger and Tom Russo. This strategy focuses on finding great businesses and buying them at reasonable prices, not cheap prices.

Dave: Carol, you're nuts. You're overpaying for growth stocks that are already hyped up. You're taking on too much risk by betting on uncertain future outcomes. You're ignoring the fact that growth is not a freebie, and that high-growth companies often face tough competition, regulatory bullshit, and changing consumer preferences. You're also relying on your own gut feelings to decide what makes a wonderful company and a fair price. You're not using any hard facts or analysis to back up your decisions. You're just following your emotions and biases. That's why I prefer the growth investing strategy, which is based on finding companies with high growth potential and investing in them before they become popular by the market. This strategy has been followed by legendary investors such as Philip Fisher, Peter Lynch, and Cathie Wood. Growth investing is the only way to beat the market and make insane returns.

Alice: Wow, that's quite a heated exchange. It seems like none of you agree with each other. How do you respond to each other's dissing?

Bob: Carol and Dave are both suckers who will lose their shirts in the next market crash. They are gambling with their money, not investing it wisely. They are following the crowd, not thinking for themselves. They are screwed.

Carol: Bob and Dave are both losers who will never achieve financial freedom. They are wasting their time, not making their money work for them. They are following outdated rules, not adapting to new realities. They are lame.

Dave: Bob and Carol are both dinosaurs who will become extinct in the next market revolution. They are ignoring innovation, not embracing change. They are following dogmas, not discovering opportunities. They are irrelevant.

Alice: Wow, you guys are really passionate about your strategies. You're not holding back any punches. Do you have any examples of wins or fails that support your arguments?

Bob: Sure I do. Look at Berkshire Hathaway, which is run by Warren Buffett, the greatest value investor of all time. Berkshire Hathaway has made its book value per share grow at an annual rate of 19% since 1965, beating the S&P 500 by a wide margin. Buffett has achieved this awesome performance by buying undervalued stocks and businesses that make tons of cash and have killer competitive advantages. On the other hand, look at Tesla, which is the poster child of growth investing. Tesla has a market value of over $1 trillion, but it barely makes any profits and faces fierce competition from old-school automakers and new players. Tesla is trading at a ridiculous valuation that assumes unrealistic growth expectations and ignores the risks and uncertainties involved. Tesla is a classic example of a growth trap,
where investors overpay for hype and hope, not reality and results.

Carol: That's bullshit, Bob. Berkshire Hathaway is a dinosaur that has sucked for over a decade. Buffett has lost his touch and has failed to adapt to the changing times. He has missed out on the most innovative and disruptive companies of the 21st century,
such as Amazon, Apple, and Netflix. These are the companies that I love and invest in. These are the companies that have created huge value for their shareholders by dominating their industries, delighting their customers, and delivering consistent and impressive growth. On the other hand, look at General Electric, which is the epitome of value investing. General Electric was once a blue-chip industrial giant that had a diversified portfolio of businesses and a strong reputation for quality and innovation. But it turned out to be a value trap, where investors bought a cheap stock that was actually a bad business that was plagued by shitty management, accounting scandals, and massive debt. General Electric has destroyed billions of dollars of shareholder value over the years, and its stock price has tanked by over 80% since its peak in 2000.

Dave: That's rubbish, Carol. Amazon, Apple, and Netflix are not wonderful companies at fair prices. They are overhyped companies at inflated prices. They are trading at crazy multiples that reflect their past performance, not their future prospects. They are facing increasing competition, regulation, and saturation in their markets. They are vulnerable to disruption by newer and nimbler players that can offer better products and services at lower prices. They are examples of growth illusions, where investors pay too much for declining growth rates and diminishing returns. On the other hand, look at Shopify, which is the embodiment of growth investing. Shopify is an e-commerce platform that enables anyone to start and grow an online business. Shopify has grown its revenue by over 50% annually for the past five years, and it has become the second-largest online retailer in the US after Amazon. Shopify is trading at a reasonable valuation that reflects its huge growth potential and its competitive edge in a massive and growing market. Shopify is an example of a growth gem, where investors pay a fair price for exceptional growth prospects and superior returns.

Alice: Wow, you guys are really into your strategies. You're not showing any signs of backing down or compromising. Do you have any final words for each other before we end this shitshow?

Bob: Yes, I do. Carol and Dave are both morons who will get burned in the next market crash. They are playing with fire, not investing smartly. They are following the hype, not thinking rationally. They are fucked.

Carol: Yes, I do. Bob and Dave are both idiots who will never get rich. They are wasting their money, not making it grow. They are following old-fashioned rules, not adapting to new opportunities. They suck.

Dave: Yes, I do. Bob and Carol are both fossils who will become history in the next market revolution. They are ignoring innovation, not embracing change. They are following dogmas, not discovering opportunities. They are toast.

Alice: Well, thank you all for joining us today on the Stock Picker Showdown. It was a wild and heated debate, to say the least. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. Before we go, we have a special guest who wants to share his opinion on this topic. Please welcome Eugene Fama, who is a Nobel winner in economics and one of the most influential dudes in finance.

Eugene: Thank you, Alice. I'm glad to be here. I have been listening to this debate with great interest and amusement. I have to say that all three of these strategies are basically pointless and useless attempts to beat the market. The market is efficient, meaning that it knows everything that you know and more, and that it prices stocks right all the time. Therefore, it is impossible to consistently beat the market by using any strategy based on public information,
such as financial ratios, growth rates, or qualitative factors. All these strategies depend on luck, not skill, and they expose investors to higher risk without higher return. The only smart way to invest in the stock market is to buy and hold a well-diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds that give you the market return with minimal fees and taxes. This is the strategy that I recommend to all investors who want to achieve

All Three Together: That's nonsense! I've beaten the market for years by actively picking stocks. Markets are irrational

Eugene: You're just one of the lucky ones. There are many more active investors who have lost money. And even if you have beaten the market in the past, there's no guarantee that you'll continue to do so in the future. Markets are efficiently inefficient.
