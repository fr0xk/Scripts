# Dogfight in Finance 

Alice: Yo yo yo, what's crackin' everyone, welcome to the Stock Picker Showdown, where we roast three different investment strategies and see who sucks the most. Today we got Bob, who's a classic value investor, Carol, who's all about wonderful companies at a fair price, and Dave, who's all about that growth game. Let's kick it off with Bob. Bob, why do you think value investing is the bomb?

Bob: Well, Alice, it's hella simple. Value investing is based on the idea that the market often screws up and misprices stocks, and by copping stocks with low price-to-book or earnings ratios, you can cash in on the market's stupidity and make crazy money. This strategy has been proven by badass investors like Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, and Joel Greenblatt. Value investing is the only smart way to play the stock market.

Carol: Oh please, Bob, don't make me barf. Value investing is dead. It's a relic of the past that don't work in today's wild and cutthroat world. You're just buying cheap trash that nobody else wants. You're falling into value traps, where you think you're getting a deal, but you're actually buying a dying business that won't bounce back. You're missing out on the real money-makers in the market, which are the dope companies with killer competitive edges, strong growth prospects, and loyal customers. These are the companies that will make you filthy rich over time. That's why I'm all about the wonderful companies at fair price strategy, made famous by Charlie Munger and Tom Russo. This strategy is all about finding great businesses and scooping them up at reasonable prices, not cheap ones.

Dave: Carol, you're trippin'. You're paying too much for hyped-up growth stocks. You're taking on mad risk by betting on uncertain futures. You're ignoring the fact that growth ain't free, and that high-growth companies face tough competition, regulatory BS, and changing consumer preferences. You're also relying on your own gut feelings to decide what's a wonderful company and a fair price. You ain't backing up your decisions with hard facts or analysis. You're just following your emotions and biases. That's why I'm all in on the growth investing strategy, which is all about finding companies with insane growth potential and investing in them before they blow up in the market. This strategy has been followed by legends like Philip Fisher, Peter Lynch, and Cathie Wood. Growth investing is the only way to smoke the market and make mind-blowing returns.

Alice: Damn, that's some intense back-and-forth. It's clear y'all ain't seeing eye to eye. How y'all gonna respond to each other's dissing?

Bob: Carol and Dave are both suckas who gonna lose everything in the next market crash. They're gambling with their dough, not investing it wisely. They're just sheep, not independent thinkers. They're screwed.

Carol: Bob and Dave are both losers who ain't never gonna achieve financial freedom. They're wasting their time, not making their money work for 'em. They're clinging to outdated rules, not adapting to new realities. They straight-up suck.

Dave: Bob and Carol are both dinosaurs who gonna be extinct in the next market revolution. They're ignoring innovation, not embracing change. They're following dogmas, not discovering opportunities. They're irrelevant.

Alice: Damn, y'all are mad passionate about your strategies. Ain't holdin' back at all. Got any examples of wins or fails that back up your arguments?

Bob: You betcha. Look at Berkshire Hathaway, run by Warren Buffett, the ultimate value investor. Berkshire Hathaway has grown its book value per share at a crazy annual rate of 19% since 1965, whooping the S&P 500's ass. Buffett achieved this sick performance by scooping up undervalued stocks and businesses that rake in tons of cash and have unbeatable competitive edges. On the flip side, peep Tesla, the poster child of growth investing. Tesla's market value is over a trillion bucks, but it barely makes any profits and faces intense competition from traditional automakers and new players. Tesla's trading at an insane valuation that assumes unrealistic growth expectations and ignores the risks and uncertainties. Tesla's a classic example of a growth trap, where investors overpay for hype and hope, not reality and results.

Carol: That's BS, Bob. Berkshire Hathaway is a fossil that's been sucking wind for over a decade. Buffett lost his magic touch and failed to adapt to the changing times. He missed out on the most innovative and disruptive companies of the 21st century, like Amazon, Apple, and Netflix. Those are the companies I love and invest in. They've created insane value for their shareholders by dominating their industries, pleasing their customers, and delivering consistent and impressive growth. On the other hand, look at General Electric, the epitome of value investing. GE used to be a top-tier industrial giant with a diversified portfolio and a reputation for quality and innovation. But it turned out to be a value trap, where investors bought into a cheap stock that was actually a crappy business plagued by terrible management, accounting scandals, and mountains of debt. GE has destroyed billions of dollars of shareholder value over the years, with its stock price tanking over 80% since its peak in 2000.

Dave: That's garbage, Carol. Amazon, Apple, and Netflix ain't wonderful companies at fair prices. They're overhyped companies at inflated prices. They're trading at insane multiples that reflect their past performance, not their future potential. They're dealing with more competition, regulations, and market saturation. They're vulnerable to disruption by newer and more agile players who offer better products and services at lower prices. They're examples of growth illusions, where investors pay too much for declining growth rates and diminishing returns. On the other hand, check out Shopify, the embodiment of growth investing. Shopify is an e-commerce platform that lets anyone start and grow an online business. Shopify has been smashing it with over 50% annual revenue growth for the past five years and has become the second-largest online retailer in the US, right behind Amazon. Shopify's trading at a reasonable valuation that reflects its massive growth potential and its edge in a massive and expanding market. Shopify's a prime example of a growth gem, where investors pay a fair price for crazy growth prospects and killer returns.

Alice: Sheesh, y'all are seriously committed to your strategies. No sign of backing down or finding common ground. Any final words for each other before we wrap up this crazy show?

Bob: Yeah, I got something to say. Carol and Dave are both idiots who gonna get burned in the next market crash. They're playing with fire, not making smart investments. They're just followers, not independent thinkers. They're screwed. Also Shopify is rekt now.

Carol: Oh, I got something to add too. Bob and Dave are both fools who ain't never gonna get rich. They're throwing away their money, not making it work for them. They're clinging to outdated rules, not seizing new opportunities. They straight-up suck.

Dave: And don't forget about me. Bob and Carol are both dinosaurs who gonna be left in the dust in the next market revolution. They're turning a blind eye to innovation, not embracing change. They're following tired dogmas, not uncovering fresh possibilities. They're toast.

Alice: Well, this debate was wild and heated, to say the least. I hope you had a blast, just like I did. Before we wrap it up, we have a special guest who wants to share his opinion on this topic. Give it up for Eugene Fama, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and one of the biggest names in finance.

Eugene: Thanks, Alice. Glad to be here. I've been listening to this debate with keen interest and amusement. Gotta say, all three of these strategies are pretty much pointless attempts to beat the market. The market is efficient, meaning it knows everything you know and then some. It prices stocks accurately all the time. So trying to consistently outperform the market using public information, like financial ratios, growth rates, or qualitative factors, is a fool's errand. All these strategies rely on luck, not skill, and expose investors to higher risk without higher returns. The only smart move is to buy and hold a well-diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds that give you the market return with minimal fees and taxes. That's the strategy I recommend to all investors who wanna achieve

All Three Together: That's nonsense! We've beaten the market for years by actively picking stocks. Markets are irrational!

Eugene: Hey, you're just the lucky ones. Plenty of active investors have lost their shirts. And even if you've beaten the market in the past, there's no guarantee you'll keep doing it in the future. Markets are efficiently inefficient.

Bob: Eugene, you're clueless, man! Your theory about market efficiency is a load of crap. If the market was so efficient, how do you explain the countless investors who have consistently outperformed it? Your index fund strategy is for sheep who can't think for themselves. Real investors take risks and make big gains. You're just trying to justify your own irrelevance.

Carol: Eugene, you're living in a bubble, dude! Your theory might sound fancy in academia, but in the real world, investors are making smart decisions and beating the market every day. Your index fund approach is a one-size-fits-all solution that completely ignores the power of research and analysis. It's lazy investing for people who don't want to put in the effort. We're here to find the diamonds in the rough, not settle for average returns.

Dave: Eugene, you're out of touch with reality, man! The market is full of irrational behavior, and it's precisely because of that irrationality that we can find opportunities and make exceptional returns. Your index fund strategy is a recipe for mediocrity. We're not interested in settling for average. We're here to aim higher, take calculated risks, and achieve extraordinary results. So save your efficient market mumbo jumbo for the textbooks, because in the real world, we're making things happen.

Trend Follower (Trevor): Yo, yo, yo! What's up, peeps? I've been listening to all this back-and-forth banter, and let me tell you, y'all are missing the real deal here. Let me break it down for ya. I'm a trend follower, and I ride the waves of market momentum. While you guys are arguing about value, growth, and all that jazz, I'm cashing in on the trends, making bank, and living the good life. I don't care about your fancy theories or historical figures. I'm all about catching the hot trends and staying ahead of the game. So, before you start dissin' on my strategy, just remember who's laughin' all the way to the bank, baby!

Bob: Trevor, my man, you're just chasing the latest fad, hoping to get lucky. You're like a leaf in the wind, drifting wherever the market takes you. You're not making calculated decisions based on fundamentals or value. You're gambling, plain and simple.

Carol: Trevor, you're relying on short-term trends without considering the long-term prospects of the companies you invest in. You're jumping from one hype train to another, without any real understanding of the businesses you're investing in. It's like you're playing a game of roulette, hoping to hit the jackpot, but in the end, you're more likely to lose it all.

Dave: Trevor, trends come and go, my friend. What's hot today might be cold tomorrow. You're not building a solid foundation for your investments. You're just chasing after shiny objects and hoping they keep shining. But when the market turns, and it always does, you'll be left holding the bag. Trends can be deceptive, and they can change on a dime. You need to have a strategy that goes beyond momentary excitement.

Trevor: Hold up, hold up! You're all missin' the point here. I ain't just blindly following trends. I've got my rules and systems in place to ride those waves. I'm not some clueless trend chaser. I analyze market data, identify patterns, and execute my trades with precision. Yeah, trends might shift, but I adapt, man. I'm not married to any one stock or strategy. I go with the flow, adjust my positions, and keep on rollin'. I'm not some wild gambler or a fly-by-night investor. I'm disciplined, calculated, and successful.

Bob: Alright, Trevor, I hear you. Maybe I was too quick to judge. If you've got a systematic approach and you're managing your risks, then maybe there's some merit to what you're doing.

Carol: You make a good point, Trevor. If you have a well-defined system and you're adapting to changing trends, then perhaps there's more to trend following than I initially thought. I shouldn't dismiss it outright.

Dave: Trevor, you've given me something to think about. If you're truly disciplined and have a well-tested methodology, then maybe there's room for trend following in the investment world. I shouldn't be so quick to dismiss it. But I don't think you will beat the market with all these extra costs associated with trading turnovers.

Alice: Well, look at that! We've reached a moment of mutual respect and understanding. Each strategy has its strengths and weaknesses, and it's important to recognize that. Trevor, you've defended yourself well, and the others have acknowledged the value in your approach. That's what this show is all about—exposing different perspectives and finding common ground. Keep on riding those trends, Trevor, and may the market waves continue to treat you well. And to our viewers, remember that there's more than one way to make those investment gains. Stay tuned for our next episode of the Stock Picker Showdown, where we'll continue to dive into the exciting world of finance!
