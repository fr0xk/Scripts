# Muscle for the Sake of Muscle: The Gym vs. Manual Labor

Look at predators in the wild, like cats and dogs. They're incredibly strong and agile, but they don't have bulging muscles. Nor do hard laborers. It's bodybuilders who do. Back in ancient Rome, people admired muscles that were used for a purpose, like fighting or building. But today, some bodybuilders just get big for the sake of being big. It's ridiculous.

Gym owners won't tell you this, because it would hurt their business, but the average gym-goer will never build "big muscles", no matter how hard they work. Many people can improve their fitness and build some muscle, but there's a genetic limit to how much muscle the average person can build. Just look at your local gym. There are people who have been training there for years but still don't have that massive look. It's not their training or their diet. It's their genetics. The fitness industry plays this down because if people realized the truth, gym memberships would plummet. But that doesn't mean there's no value in working out at a gym. But no gym or workout routine can ever change your base genetics. I'm not about that foolish gym nonsense. It's for city people who don't know the value of hard labor. I'd rather roll up my sleeves and work with my uncle in the garden. He has me lugging around bricks, shifting logs for the campfire, and moving with the cows. I come close to keeling over from the daily grind with him, but I'm in great shape. I don't look pumped up, but I'm strong enough to defend myself and I can build real tangible stuff that I use.

Unlike the gym where people burn their calories up, I build real tangible stuff that I use: boundaries to keep cows out of my crops, logs for the campfire, fences to keep my animals in, bicycles and cars, and even minor plumbing repairs. I have a mini laser welding machine in my backyard to melt absolutely anything. I hammer metal to give it new shapes in the grass field and lift shit with levers (because I'm not bulky enough). I'm educated, but I'm not a fool. I know the limitations and truth of academic research reports. I only allow school and colleges to help me in my work, not make me a slave to their system. The difference between gym-goers and manual laborers is that gym-goers pay the fitness industry because they earn so much that they end up overeating, getting fat, and feeling depressed at home, knowing they're nearly useless without that job in an air-conditioned room. It's a privileged life. So they go to the gym just to undo the mess of life that the system has imposed on them for the last 20-30 years. Manual labor, on the other hand, is like a free gym in an open field in an extreme environment without a coach. You get your gym nutrition for free, your colleagues become your buddies, and you're looked down upon by the same privileged men and women in society. But you can survive absolutely anything, in any country, in any situation, in any combat or conflict in life. You have no fear of death. College and academics couldn't brainwash you into their educated slave mindset.

That's the difference. Screw it.
