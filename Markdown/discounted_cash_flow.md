# Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

DCF is a method used to determine the present value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. To determine the present value, we discount each future cash flow by a discount rate, which is the interest rate that could be earned if the money was invested elsewhere. You need to know two things: how much money the piggy bank will give you each year, and how much you can earn by putting your money somewhere else, like a bank account. The first thing is called the future cash flow, and the second thing is called the discount rate.

## Calculating DCF

To calculate DCF, we need to determine the future cash flows and the discount rate. Once we have this information, we can use the following steps:

1. Discount each future cash flow by the discount rate.

2. Sum all discounted future cash flows to calculate the DCF.

For example, suppose we have a piggy bank that will give us $10 in year one, $15 in year two, $20 in year three, $25 in year four, and $30 in year five. If the discount rate is 5%, we can calculate the DCF as follows:

Discount factor:

- Year 1: 1 / (1 + 5%) = 0.95

- Year 2: 1 / (1 + 5%)^2 = 0.90

- Year 3: 1 / (1 + 5%)^3 = 0.86

- Year 4: 1 / (1 + 5%)^4 = 0.82

- Year 5: 1 / (1 + 5%)^5 = 0.78

Discounted cash flow:

- Year 1: $10 * 0.95 = $9.50

- Year 2: $15 * 0.90 = $13.50

- Year 3: $20 * 0.86 = $17.10

- Year 4: $25 * 0.82 = $20.40

- Year 5: $30 * 0.78 = $23.40

DCF = $9.50 + $13.50 + $17.10 + $20.40 + $23.40 = $83.90

Therefore, the piggy bank is worth $83.90 today if the discount rate is 5%. If it is being offered for less than $83.90, it is a good deal, and if it is being offered for more than $83.90, it is a bad deal.

## Cons of DCF

- Requires making assumptions that can be incorrect and significantly impact the value of the investment.

- Not suitable for investments that do not provide regular cash flows, such as non-profitable toys or businesses.

## Behavioral Biases

- Overconfidence: Being too optimistic about future cash flows or the discount rate can cause overvaluation of the investment.

- Anchoring: Being influenced by an initial value suggested by someone else, even if it's not justified by the actual cash flows or discount rate.

- Loss aversion: Fear of loss can lead to avoidance of buying or early selling, even when the investment is a good deal.

Note: For novices, use traditional price to revenue ratio around < 1-3. Valuation multiple is nothing but shortcut of DCF. Over large amount of holdings, it will produce same results over someone doing hour after hour of spreadsheet analysis.
