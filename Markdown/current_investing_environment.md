## Article: The Impact of Financial Crisis, Behavioral Biases, and Political Beliefs on the Modern Financial Landscape



### Introduction

In a hypothetical scenario where the financial crisis of 2008 didn't occur, it's conceivable that the Madoff scam would have continued undetected until the present day. This would have had significant implications considering the prevailing trends and behaviors in the financial landscape.

Currently, individuals have grown accustomed to receiving financial aid easily and having convenient access to funds. Moreover, they have become accustomed to witnessing unpredictable changes in the market. Consequently, there is a tendency to heavily rely on quotes from influential investors like Warren Buffet. Unfortunately, this often leads to insufficient attention being paid to investment risks, market fluctuations, and the true value of their investments. People tend to utilize various tools and information that reinforce their existing beliefs, potentially exacerbating the issue.

Given this context, it becomes clear that a substantial negative event would be necessary to instill fear in shareholders and prompt them to reconsider their investment strategies. Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge the existence of contemporary manifestations of hazardous overconfidence. These include the idea that despite being susceptible to reckless interference, the global economy cannot be fundamentally dismantled. Additionally, there is a notion that the stability of US political institutions is inherently bestowed and everlasting. Lastly, some individuals believe that moral absolutism, which dismisses opposing perspectives as perpetually foolish or driven by deceitful motives and self-centeredness, is the optimal means of upholding democracy and freedom.

A significant aspect that has influenced the financial landscape is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision to permit companies to repurchase their own stocks. As a result, companies have the ability to extract funds from investors without providing dividends until the company fails. Importantly, it is crucial to note that companies are not legally obligated to fulfill these promises, but they are rather legally encouraged to make them as a part of their strategic approach. This has implications for investors and shareholders alike.

### Behavioral Biases and Financial Trends

In today's financial climate, individuals have become accustomed to receiving financial aid easily and having convenient access to funds. However, this ease can lead to behavioral biases that impact decision-making. Common biases such as confirmation bias and herd mentality often prevail, with investors relying heavily on advice from influential figures like Warren Buffet. Consequently, proper risk assessment and accurate valuation of investments may be overlooked.

### Contemporary Manifestations of Hazardous Overconfidence

It is crucial to recognize the presence of hazardous overconfidence in current beliefs. The notion that the global economy is immune to complete dismantlement despite vulnerabilities to reckless interference is one manifestation. Furthermore, there is a prevailing belief in the inherent and everlasting stability of US political institutions, potentially leading to a disregard for risks and vulnerabilities. Additionally, moral absolutism dismisses opposing perspectives as perpetually foolish or driven by deceitful motives and self-centeredness, impacting the discourse on upholding democracy and freedom.

### The SEC Rule Change and Investor Implications

The SEC's decision in 1983 to permit companies to repurchase their own stocks has significant implications for investors. This ruling allows companies to extract funds from investors without providing dividends until the company fails. Importantly, there is no legal obligation for companies to fulfill these promises; rather, they are encouraged to make them as part of their strategic approach. Investors must carefully evaluate these transactions, considering the associated risks.
