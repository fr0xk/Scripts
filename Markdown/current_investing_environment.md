## The Impact of Financial Crisis, Behavioral Biases, and Political Beliefs on the Modern Financial Landscape



### Introduction

I have an inherent inclination to disrupt the norm and challenge established paradigms, driven by the understanding that the dynamics of various phenomena, ranging from the unfolding of events to the volatility of prices, undergo continuous evolution with the passage of time. Now, allow me to delve into a rather intriguing aspect: during periods characterized by heightened unpredictability, an underlying thread of predictability tends to emerge, while in instances of diminished unpredictability, an amplified level of unpredictability paradoxically comes into play.

Drawing upon this unconventional concept, let's explore a scenario where you aspire to adhere to a specific pattern or strategy. Remarkably, the optimal juncture to initiate your adherence is when this pattern has experienced six consecutive failures. Conversely, if the pattern has achieved six consecutive successes, that is precisely when you should consider adopting a diametrically opposite approach. It is worth noting that the specific value of six is not of paramount significance; it is employed purely as an illustrative device to reinforce the essence of my argument. By embracing this counterintuitive perspective, one can navigate the intricacies of dynamic systems with greater resilience and adaptability.

In a hypothetical scenario where the financial crisis of 2008 didn't occur, it's conceivable that the Madoff scam would have continued undetected until the present day. This would have had significant implications considering the prevailing trends and behaviors in the financial landscape.

Currently, individuals have grown accustomed to receiving financial aid easily and having convenient access to funds. Moreover, they have become accustomed to witnessing unpredictable changes in the market. Consequently, there is a tendency to heavily rely on quotes from influential investors like Warren Buffet. Unfortunately, this often leads to insufficient attention being paid to investment risks, market fluctuations, and the true value of their investments. People tend to utilize various tools and information that reinforce their existing beliefs, potentially exacerbating the issue.

Given this context, it becomes clear that a substantial negative event would be necessary to instill fear in shareholders and prompt them to reconsider their investment strategies. Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge the existence of contemporary manifestations of hazardous overconfidence. These include the idea that despite being susceptible to reckless interference, the global economy cannot be fundamentally dismantled. Additionally, there is a notion that the stability of US political institutions is inherently bestowed and everlasting. Lastly, some individuals believe that moral absolutism, which dismisses opposing perspectives as perpetually foolish or driven by deceitful motives and self-centeredness, is the optimal means of upholding democracy and freedom.

A significant aspect that has influenced the financial landscape is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision to permit companies to repurchase their own stocks. As a result, companies have the ability to extract funds from investors without providing dividends until the company fails. Importantly, it is crucial to note that companies are not legally obligated to fulfill these promises, but they are rather legally encouraged to make them as a part of their strategic approach. This has implications for investors and shareholders alike.

The old axioms of "time in the market" and the "power of compounding" hold true, but their validity depends on safeguarding the principal value throughout the investment journey. If the principal is lost, both the concept of "time" and the potential magic of compounding are compromised. To illustrate this point, let's consider an example: Imagine you invest $10,000 in a stock market index fund, but due to market volatility, the value drops to $7,000. While you may aim to "get back to even" by waiting for the market to recover and reach $10,000 again, another investor who initially invested the same amount sees steady growth and their portfolio reaches $12,000 during the recovery period. Although both investments eventually reach the initial $10,000, the other investor has experienced true growth, whereas your investment merely recovered the principal without capturing the benefits of compounding and the potential for significant long-term growth.

### Conclusion

Based on capitalism ideas, we offer the following suggestions:

- Encourage thorough risk assessment and valuation of investments to mitigate the impact of behavioral biases.

- Foster awareness of the potential risks and vulnerabilities in the global economy, even amidst periods of stability.

- Promote open-mindedness and the consideration of diverse perspectives to ensure a robust democracy and freedom.

- Enhance transparency and accountability in the financial system to protect investor interests.

By addressing these points and incorporating classical capitalism principles, we can work towards a more resilient and sustainable financial landscape.
