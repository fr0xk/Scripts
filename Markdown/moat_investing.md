- Keeping SG&A expenses below 30% shows that the company is being managed efficiently.

- Depreciation below 8% indicates that the company has invested in assets that are expected to retain their value for a long time.

- Interest expense less than 15% means that the company is able to manage its debt effectively and can meet its financial obligations.

- An effective income tax rate of around 21% suggests that the company is operating in a tax-efficient manner.

- A profit margin of greater than 20% demonstrates that the company is able to generate significant profits from its operations.

- CapEx less than 10% indicates that the company is not overinvesting in fixed assets and is keeping capital expenditures in check.

- A debt to adjusted equity ratio less than 0.80 suggests that the company is not over-leveraged and has a healthy balance sheet.

- An ROE greater than 15% indicates that the company is generating a strong return on investment for its shareholders.

Based on our analysis, we believe that the company meets our investment criteria and represents a compelling investment opportunity.
