# Intelligent Speculation and Investment

According to Benjamin Graham in his book "The Intelligent Investor," intelligent speculation requires careful consideration of relevant facts and experience-based measurement of probabilities. When the probabilities are in favor of the speculation, diversification can transform it into an investment. Graham suggests that the key to successful speculation in Wall Street is to get the odds on your side by skillful, experienced calculation. He emphasizes that it is a mistake to consider a speculation unwise solely because you lose money on it. A speculation is unwise only if it is made on insufficient study and poor judgment.

> "Intelligent speculation presupposes at least that the mathematical possibilities are not against the speculation, basing the measurement of these odds on experience and the careful weighing of relevant facts." - Benjamin Graham

# The Role of Psychological Factors in Stock Valuations

Graham notes that investors have introduced serious speculative elements into common stock valuations by paying high prices for so-called quality and future prospects. These elements create fluctuations in investors' attitudes, which are based on psychological factors rather than fixed data such as dividends. The psychological attitude towards prospects and quality is subject to wide changes, leading to fluctuations in stock valuations.

> "Matters of the former kind — I am speaking now of prospects and quality — are subject to wide changes in the psychological attitude of the people who buy and sell stocks." - Benjamin Graham

# The Importance of Skillful Calculation in Speculation

Graham compares speculation to playing bridge, emphasizing the importance of playing a hand right rather than playing it successfully. In Wall Street, speculation requires careful calculation and skillful decision-making. While some speculations may not work out, this is simply part of the game, and there are opportunities for profit in sound speculation.

> "It is a great mistake to believe that a speculation has been unwise if you lose money at it...If it was bound to work out rightly, it wouldn’t be a speculation at all, and there wouldn’t be the opportunities of profit that inhere in sound speculation. It seems to me that is axiomatic." - Benjamin Graham

Overall, Graham's philosophy on speculation and investment stresses the importance of careful consideration of facts and probabilities, as well as skillful calculation and decision-making. While there are inherent risks in speculation, there are also opportunities for profit if approached with an intelligent and informed mindset.
