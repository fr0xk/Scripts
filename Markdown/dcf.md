# Discounted Cash Flow

Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a method used to determine the present value of a company by forecasting its future cash flows and discounting them by a certain rate. This rate, known as the discount rate, takes into account the time value of money and the risk associated with investing in the company.

## Example

To understand how DCF works, let's consider a hypothetical company. This company has a revenue of $100 and a profit margin of 12%, which means its earnings per share (EPS) is $12. If the company grows at an annualized rate of 3%, its EPS in year 1 will be $12 * 1.03 = $12.36. In year 2, its EPS will be $12.36 * 1.03 = $12.73 and so on.

Now, let's say the country in which the company operates offers a 10-year bond with a 4% yield. Instead of investing in the company, an investor could choose to buy the bond and earn a risk-free return of 4%. This is taken into account when calculating the discount rate.

To calculate the present value of the company, we need to discount its future earnings by the discount rate. The present value of the company's earnings in year 1 will be $12.36 / (1 + 0.04) = $11.88. In year 2, the present value of its earnings will be $12.73 / (1 + 0.04)^2 = $11.77 and so on.

By adding up the present value of all future earnings, we can calculate the present value of the company. This represents the maximum amount an investor should be willing to pay for shares in the company today.

### Calculation

For example, if we want to calculate the present value of the company for the next 10 years, we can use the following formula:

Present Value = EPS / (1 + Discount Rate)^Number of Years

Using this formula and the given information, we can calculate the present value of the company's earnings for the next 10 years as follows:

Year 1: $12 * 1.03 / (1 + 0.04) = $11.88

Year 2: $12 * 1.03^2 / (1 + 0.04)^2 = $11.77

Year 3: $12 * 1.03^3 / (1 + 0.04)^3 = $11.66
...

Year 10: $12 * 1.03^10 / (1 + 0.04)^10 = $10.82

By adding up the present value of the company's earnings for each year, we get a total present value of $115.45.

This means that an investor should be willing to pay a maximum of $115.45 for shares in the company today if they expect to earn a return equal to the discount rate of 4%.

## Summary

In summary, discounted cash flow is a powerful tool that investors can use to determine the present value of a company by forecasting its future cash flows and discounting them by a certain rate. Price is what you pay, value is what you get. A good company, a great company or a junk company - it doesnâ€™t matter as long as either the balance sheet or cash flows are strong and the price paid is cheap enough
