# 10-Month Study Plan for CBSE Physics Class 12

This study plan is designed to cover the entire physics curriculum for Class 12 in 10 months, including topics from Class 11. It is important to note that this plan is just a guideline and can be adjusted according to individual needs and pace of learning.

## Month 1-2: Mechanics

### Topics to cover:

- Kinematics

- Laws of Motion

- Work, Energy and Power

- System of Particles and Rotational Motion

### Suggestions:

- Start with a quick review of the basic concepts from Class 11 Physics, especially in the areas of kinematics and laws of motion.

- Focus on understanding the concepts and their real-world applications, rather than just memorizing formulas.

- Solve a few numerical problems to develop problem-solving skills, but don't spend too much time on this.

- Pay attention to derivations and proofs of important formulas.

## Month 3-4: Thermodynamics and Waves

### Topics to cover:

- Thermal Properties of Matter

- Thermodynamics

- Waves

- Oscillations

### Suggestions:

- Cover both Thermodynamics and Waves in parallel, with an emphasis on understanding concepts rather than numerical problems.

- Use diagrams, charts, and animations to visualize concepts and their applications.

- Make connections between different concepts to better understand their interdependence.

- Focus on important derivations and proofs, rather than attempting to solve too many numerical problems.

## Month 5-6: Electromagnetism

### Topics to cover:

- Electrostatics

- Current Electricity

- Magnetic Effects of Current and Magnetism

### Suggestions:

- Start with the basic laws and principles of electrostatics and magnetism before diving into the complex topics.

- Focus on practical applications of electromagnetic concepts.

- Take notes on important formulas and concepts, but don't get bogged down with too many numerical problems.

- Pay attention to derivations and proofs of important formulas.

## Month 7-8: Modern Physics

### Topics to cover:

- Dual Nature of Radiation and Matter

- Atoms and Nuclei

- Electronic Devices

### Suggestions:

- Start with the historical context of modern physics to understand the development of these theories.

- Focus on understanding the concepts and their applications, rather than solving too many numerical problems.

- Make connections between different concepts to better understand their interdependence.

- Pay attention to derivations and proofs of important formulas.

## Month 9-10: Revision and Practice

### Suggestions:

- Review all the topics covered in the previous months.

- Solve previous year's question papers and mock tests to practice time management and exam skills.

- Focus on problem-solving strategies and techniques.

- Prioritize weak areas and work on them to improve your overall performance.

Remember, it's important to focus on understanding the concepts and their applications rather than just solving numerical problems. Prioritizing important derivations and proofs will help build a strong foundation in Physics. Good luck with your studies!
