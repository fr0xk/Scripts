# The Myth of Free Will and the Power of Privilege: Unraveling Life's Unfairness

In a world where individualism and personal responsibility are highly praised, let's expose the myth of free will. The belief that we have complete control over every aspect of our lives is often misleading and a failure to recognize privilege's profound impact. The things we genuinely control are limited. Deciding whether to study or waste time might seem like a small choice, but even that isn't always straightforward. It's akin to deciding between broccoli and chocolate cake when you're trying to eat healthily – the cake is tempting, but it won't help your waistline. In reality, we can only work with what we can influence.

Let's start with the "tyranny of beauty," present throughout society. In romance, in employment, even just in day-to-day stuff, looks matter. However, it's one of those things society denies, even though studies have shown it's quite real. It's just too hard for people to accept, so they deny it's real. In psychology, it's called the "halo effect." We study in psychology that humans want to associate themselves with good-looking people. Because back when we were still cavemen, it was our evolutionary instinct. If you’re fat, you can’t run and hunt properly, so it was natural for humans to not want to associate with someone who can’t contribute. But we are no longer in that survival situation, but our hormones and natural instincts are still taking time to adjust, which makes sense because our species is 2 million years old but modern society is less than 4000-5000 years old. It's disheartening to witness people who seem to invest less effort achieving more, particularly in their pursuit of higher education abroad. It's as if some individuals receive a fast pass to success while the rest of us are stuck in line at the DMV. Privilege, in all its forms, significantly contributes to these disparities. Some may claim to work hard, but their capacity to put in a more substantial effort often stems from the privilege they enjoy. It's similar to starting a race with a head start, while others are still tying their shoelaces, and then proclaiming victory. This privilege frequently goes unnoticed, just like those elusive cookie crumbs in your bed.

Life can be staggeringly unfair, and the lack of control over our circumstances is exasperating. It's like trying to grasp a slippery pig – no matter how hard you try, it keeps slipping away. It's entirely natural to question and resist this injustice. That's why free will, in many cases, is a misleading idea. Privilege extends beyond financial means; it encompasses various aspects of life, such as intellectual abilities, physical appearance, gender, and more. It's as if some people play the game of life with cheat codes activated, while the rest of us are stuck with standard settings. Now, let's discuss the self-fulfilling prophecy of privilege. It's comparable to having a lucky charm that you believe will bring you good fortune. For instance, consider a person who insists that wearing mismatched socks is the key to their success. Remarkably, every time they don mismatched socks, they have a fantastic day. It's not the socks themselves; it's their belief in the socks that brings about the success. Likewise, privilege often leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy where those who possess it believe they will succeed, and this belief often becomes a reality, further reinforcing the cycle of privilege.

For individuals who identify as less privileged, the anger stemming from these inequalities is a valid and potent emotion. It's not something to be dismissed or lectured against. It's akin to trying to calm a thunderstorm with an umbrella – it won't be effective. This anger can serve as a driving force, a catalyst for change, and a guardian of one's self-respect. It's as though the universe has given you a boxing glove and challenged you to fight back. It's a way of expressing dissent in an unjust world. We have every right to resist and speak out against the injustices we encounter. Consider this: If historical figures who fought for social change, such as feminists, activists, and politicians, had not channeled their anger into action, we might still be stuck in the 18th century, enduring the same old injustices. It's as if they collectively said, "Enough is enough!" and led a revolution. Anger is not a futile emotion; it often serves as the starting point for positive change. In conclusion, free will is not the all-powerful force it's often portrayed to be. Privilege, in its various forms, significantly influences our opportunities and outcomes. As less privileged individuals, our anger and resistance are valid responses to the injustice we encounter. It's through this anger that we can challenge the status quo and work toward a fairer and more equitable society.
