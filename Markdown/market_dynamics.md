# Changes in Valuation Methods since 1800

Valuation is the process of estimating the worth of an asset or company based on factors like cash flows, earnings, growth, assets, liabilities, market conditions, and investor expectations. Valuation methods have evolved since 1800 due to changes in information availability, financial theories, new sectors/markets, and investor preferences.

## Availability of Information

* In the 1800s, information about companies was scarce, unreliable, and costly to obtain. Valuation methods were based on book value, i.e., the net worth of assets minus liabilities.
* In the 1900s, information became more abundant, accessible, and standardized. Valuation methods incorporated market value, i.e., the price investors are willing to pay for a company's shares.

## Development of Financial Theories

* In the 1800s, classical economics assumed that markets were efficient, rational, and self-regulating. Valuation methods relied on fundamental analysis, i.e., intrinsic value and performance of individual companies.
* In the 1900s, behavioral economics recognized that markets were often inefficient, irrational, and subject to biases. Valuation methods relied on technical analysis, i.e., price movements and trends of the market as a whole.

## Emergence of New Sectors and Markets

* In the 1800s, the stock market was dominated by finance, transportation, and industrial companies, especially railroads and steel. Valuation methods relied on dividend discount models.
* In the 1900s, new sectors like energy, consumer goods, utilities, telecommunications, and technology emerged. Valuation methods relied on discounted cash flow models.

## Evolution of Investor Preferences and Expectations

* In the 1800s, investors preferred companies that paid regular and high dividends. Valuation methods relied on dividend yield.
* In the 1900s, investors were more interested in capital appreciation, i.e., the increase in the value of investments. Valuation methods incorporated price-earnings ratio, i.e., the ratio of a company's stock price to its earnings per share.

## Evolution of Investor Preferences and Expectations:

* Investors are becoming increasingly interested in long-term growth and sustainability, with a focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. This has led to the development of new valuation methods that incorporate ESG considerations, such as ESG scoring and impact investing. In the future, we can expect these methods to become more prevalent as investors seek to align their investments with their values.
