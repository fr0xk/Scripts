## TLDR:

* **Skeptical of science and religion coexisting peacefully.**
  
* **Science thrives on evidence, logic, and evolves with new discoveries; religion often relies on faith and ancient texts, sometimes clashing with science.**
  
* **Both fields can be manipulated (e.g., Tuskegee study, Lysenkoism, tobacco industry).**
  
* **Deism is a possible compromise: acknowledging the universe's complexity without attributing it to a specific deity.**
  
* **Criticisms of media bias, scientific dogmatism, censorship, and social/political agendas.**
  
* **Pessimistic outlook on the future due to societal issues and lack of "fairness."**


Can science and religion really get along? It's a question that's been bugging a lot of us, and as a skeptical mind, I can't help but wonder if their coexistence is just wishful thinking. Science, with its fancy reliance on hard evidence and logical reasoning, often finds itself at odds with religion, which operates on faith and personal beliefs. The gap between these two worlds is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole – it just doesn't seem to fit, you know?

Science, always changing and evolving, is all about unraveling the mysteries of the natural world. It's all about meticulous observation, experiments up the wazoo, and sharp thinking. It has led us to mind-blowing advancements and breakthroughs that have transformed our understanding of the universe. Look at the theory of evolution, for instance. Supported by a mountain of evidence from diverse scientific disciplines, it knocks traditional religious beliefs about the origin of species out of the park. And recent strides made in neuroscience help us make sense of our own minds and consciousness, which used to be solely attributed to the man upstairs.  On the other hand, religion offers comfort, purpose, and a moral compass for many. It taps into our deepest metaphysical desires, promising a connection to something bigger than ourselves. But here's the rub: religious beliefs often rely on ancient texts and traditions that are open to interpretation and manipulation. Some folks take these interpretations to justify things that just don't jive with scientific evidence. We're talking about conflicts arising when religious doctrines clash with established scientific principles, like denying the age of the Earth or brushing off the solid evidence for human evolution. Let's take various traditional definition of "God" as example.

## Unsubstantiated Claims

Imagine if:

- I insisted I could defy Earth's gravity and leap into space but never demonstrated it.
- I claimed the sky is green in daylight despite it being objectively blue.
- I asserted an apple and a banana are identical but failed to prove it.
- I declared I could surpass light speed instantly but couldn't show it.

Do you notice a pattern?

## Lack of Evidence for Gods

There's no real, demonstrable proof for any supernatural entities that is capable of operating beyond the laws of physics. Claims lack factual, objective, observable, testable evidence and rely on faith or failed religious excuses.

People assert such existence for centuries without evidence. It's rational to conclude they likely don't exist unless proven otherwise. The strong atheist stance is more justified, given the lack of analytical, logical, and empirical evidence for gods. Stating "There is/are no god(s)" isn't a belief; it's a statement of nonbelief.

Now, some people argue that science and religion can find common ground through flexible interpretations and personal experiences. They say religion can adapt alongside scientific discoveries. Well, it's true that some folks choose to see religious texts as metaphorical or symbolic to accommodate scientific insights, those interpretations are usually subjective and don't necessarily reflect what the religious community at large believes. Question is - Is science immune to these kinds of manipulation? Now lets look into a bit history:

- The Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932-1972): This study conducted by the United States Public Health Service aimed to observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis in African-American men. The researchers withheld treatment from the participants without their informed consent, even after the discovery of penicillin as an effective treatment. This unethical experiment violated basic principles of medical ethics and led to significant harm to the participants.

- Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union (1930s-1960s): Trofim Lysenko, a Soviet biologist, promoted Lamarckian inheritance and denied the principles of Mendelian genetics. His ideas gained political favor and were enforced as the official state doctrine, With the backing of powerful figures, Lysenko's pseudoscientific beliefs were elevated to the status of state doctrine. The consequences were dire, as the Soviet government embarked on a campaign to suppress any opposition to Lysenko's ideas, unleashing a wave of persecution against geneticists and biologists who dared to challenge the prevailing narrative. This led to setbacks in Soviet genetics and agricultural practices.

- The tobacco industry's manipulation of scientific research (20th century): For many years, tobacco companies funded and manipulated scientific research to downplay the health risks associated with smoking. They cherry-picked data, suppressed unfavorable findings, and created doubt regarding the link between smoking and diseases such as lung cancer. This allowed them to continue promoting their products and mislead the public about their dangers.

Recent case of vaccination during COVID crisis: the majority of scientific research supports the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, but let's not turn a blind eye to the fact that science ain't immune to biases or external pressures. We've seen cases where data gets twisted or dissenting views get squashed. Isn't it like they're plae? So, it's only right to approach scientific claims with a healthy dose of skepticism, demanding transparency and integrity.

I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this, but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious, then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.”

Richard Feynman once cautioned, "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool." Today, science is also misused as a religion and political agenda to manipulate the masses through censorship. For instance, when scientists treat theories as dogma, dissenting voices are suppressed, hindering genuine inquiry. Similarly, in politics, selective disclosure of scientific information can distort reality and shape public opinion. Censorship controls the flow of information, limiting diverse perspectives. There are common practices of cherry-picking – taking the convenient verses while tossing aside the inconvenient truths (intentionally or unintentionally). That's like trying to have your cake and eat it too. But we can't ignore the elephant in the room when it comes to "trust the science." Now, vaccines – those miraculous scientific achievements have become quite the hot potato. It's a touchy subject with debates raging over safety and effectiveness. Skepticism about vaccines stems from some shady business. We're talking about possibilities of data manipulation, conflicts of interest, and the suppression of dissenting voices within the scientific community. Now, vaccination may or may not be an optimal solution. But if you dare to question it, you're fucked. Now, that's not science, that's a political agenda. That's a bunch of bullshit.

## The case of deism

Alright, I still grapple with the universe's absurd complexity. It screams "someone set this up!" But the whole divine intervention schtick just doesn't sit right. So, here's my unorthodox idea: maybe a spark ignited the cosmic engine, then **vanished.** No angels, no commandments, just a "boom, here's reality, go nuts" approach.

Think of it like baking a cake. You create the recipe, set the oven, and boom, self-sufficient cake. The universe might be that cake, baking itself according to fundamental laws laid down by some **mysterious initial force.**

This "deist" view avoids religion's baggage. No prophets, no guilt trips, just appreciating the universe's mind-blowing awesomeness. It's a respectful nod to the "whodunnit?" without needing a specific cosmic culprit.

Sure, it doesn't answer everything, but it's intellectually elegant. We can marvel at the universe without needing a cosmic chef to take a bow. The unknown, maybe, is divine enough.

So, I find deism weirdly appealing. It doesn't force me to swallow the religious pill, but it acknowledges the mystery in a way that feels honest and kind of… liberating.

I mean, really, take a moment to think about what the fuck is going on around the world. We're bombarded with CNBC's fundamental bullshit, media telling us to unquestioningly trust the so-called "science," and forced to cater to every demand of the LGBTQ+ community & how politicians redefining recession, inflation, and shoving gender identity down our throats. It's like we're drowning in a sea of pollution and there's no end in sight. How the hell are people supposed to live in this era of absolute chaos? I'm not one to make predictions, but there a probability or possibility that there's a massacre waiting for us. It's the consequence of the sheer stupidity and nonsense we're collectively engaged in. Fairness demands? Give me a break! Life isn't fair, and we shouldn't be striving for some utopian ideal where everyone gets what they want. It's a dangerous game we're playing, and I think we're going to pay the price for it.
