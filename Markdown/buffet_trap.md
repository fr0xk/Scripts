# The Warren Buffett Trap: How to Lose Money by Copying the Oracle of Omaha (Satire)

Warren Buffett is one of the richest men in the world, thanks to his knack for buying cheap stocks and holding them forever [(except when he doesn't).](https://www.cxoadvisory.com/animal-spirits/why-dont-we-all-just-do-what-warren-buffett-does/). He is the boss of Berkshire Hathaway, a giant conglomerate that owns everything from insurance to candy. He is widely revered as a saint of value investing, a religion that worships buying bargains and shunning fads 

Some skeptics say that Buffett's image and words may not always match his deeds and motives. They say that he is more of a spin doctor than a true value investor, and that he often breaks his own rules. For example, he preaches about "never losing money" then he loses a bunch of billon on ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ: KHC), Tesco PLC (LSE: TSCO.L), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM) also plays with derivatives that he once called weapons of mass destruction. He also talks about paying a "fair price" for a stock, but this is a meaningless term that can be twisted to suit any whim. It is fair only to the extent of one's own delusions. Different people may use that term differently to rationalize their own mistakes.

Some fools may fall into the trap of blindly following Buffett's tips or copying his portfolio (buying overhyped companies at inflated prices instead of wonderful companies at fair prices), without knowing the why and how behind his moves. They may also ignore the fact that Buffett has access to special deals and resources that are out of reach for most ordinary investors. For example, he can strike sweetheart deals with companies that need cash or clout, such as his bets on Goldman Sachs and Bank of America during the panic. He can also use his fame and connections to get secrets and information that are not public domain.

Therefore, it may not be smart to simply do what Buffett does or says, without doing your own homework and thinking. There may be other ways that are more suited for your own needs and tastes. For example, some investors may like dividends and innovation over buybacks and stagnation. They may also prefer more factual and numerical methods of valuation over vague and emotional ones.

Sure, here are some of the myths about Warren Buffett, along with evidence to debunk them:

**Myth:** Warren Buffett is a value investor.

**Evidence:** While Buffett is known for his value investing approach, he has also made some significant bets on derivatives and other complex financial instruments. For example, in 2008, Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, wrote billions of dollars in put options on the S&P 500 index. These options gave Berkshire the right to sell the index at a predetermined price, even if the market price fell below that level. This was a risky bet, but it paid off handsomely when the market crashed in 2008.

**Myth:** Warren Buffett is a nice guy.

**Evidence:** Buffett has a reputation for being a kind and generous man. However, there is some evidence to suggest that this persona is just a carefully cultivated image. For example, in 2011, Buffett was criticized for his handling of the Goldman Sachs bailout. Buffett had been a vocal critic of derivatives, but he agreed to invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs, which was heavily exposed to derivatives. This investment was seen by some as a betrayal of Buffett's principles.

**Myth:** Warren Buffett is a long-term investor.

**Evidence:** Buffett is known for his long-term investment horizon. However, he has also made some short-term trades that have turned out to be very profitable. For example, in 2008, Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, bought a large stake in Goldman Sachs. This was a short-term trade, as Buffett expected Goldman Sachs' stock price to rebound after the market crash. The trade paid off handsomely, as Goldman Sachs' stock price more than doubled in the following two years.

**Myth:** Warren Buffett made all his money from investing.

**Evidence:** Buffett did make a lot of money from investing, but he also inherited a significant amount of wealth from his insurance business "GEICO". In addition, Buffett has benefited from the fact that he is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, which is one of the largest and most successful companies in the world.

**Myth:** Warren Buffett is a straight shooter.

**Evidence:** Buffett is known for his honesty and transparency. However, there have been some instances where he has been accused of misleading investors. For example, in 2001, Buffett was accused of misleading investors about the financial condition of Berkshire Hathaway's subsidiary, General Re. Buffett denied the allegations, but the case was settled out of court.

**Myth:** Warren Buffett is your grandpa.

**Evidence:** Buffett is often portrayed as a kind and grandfatherly figure. However, he is a complex and powerful individual. He is also a billionaire, and his wealth gives him a lot of influence.

In summary, Warren Buffett is undoubtedly a great investor who has achieved amazing results over many years. But he is not perfect or all-knowing, and his style may not be the best match for everyone. Investors should beware of the dangers of following him too closely or blindly, and instead develop their own independent thinking and judgement.
