# The Warren Buffett Trap: How to Lose Money by Copying the Oracle of Omaha (Satire)

Warren Buffett is one of the richest men in the world, thanks to his knack for buying cheap stocks and holding them forever [(except when he doesn't).](https://www.cxoadvisory.com/animal-spirits/why-dont-we-all-just-do-what-warren-buffett-does/). He is the boss of Berkshire Hathaway, a giant conglomerate that owns everything from insurance to candy. He is widely revered as a saint of value investing, a religion that worships buying bargains and shunning fads 

Some skeptics say that Buffett's image and words may not always match his deeds and motives. They say that he is more of a spin doctor than a true value investor, and that he often breaks his own rules. For example, he preaches about "never losing money" then he loses a bunch of billon on NYSE:INTEL, also plays with derivatives that he once called weapons of mass destruction. He also talks about paying a "fair price" for a stock, but this is a meaningless term that can be twisted to suit any whim. It is fair only to the extent of one's own delusions. Different people may use that term differently to rationalize their own mistakes.

Some fools may fall into the trap of blindly following Buffett's tips or copying his portfolio (buying overhyped companies at inflated prices instead of wonderful companies at fair prices), without knowing the why and how behind his moves. They may also ignore the fact that Buffett has access to special deals and resources that are out of reach for most ordinary investors. For example, he can strike sweetheart deals with companies that need cash or clout, such as his bets on Goldman Sachs and Bank of America during the panic. He can also use his fame and connections to get secrets and information that are not public domain.

Therefore, it may not be smart to simply do what Buffett does or says, without doing your own homework and thinking. There may be other ways that are more suited for your own needs and tastes. For example, some investors may like dividends and innovation over buybacks and stagnation. They may also prefer more factual and numerical methods of valuation over vague and emotional ones.

In summary, Warren Buffett is undoubtedly a great investor who has achieved amazing results over many years. But he is not perfect or all-knowing, and his style may not be the best match for everyone. Investors should beware of the dangers of following him too closely or blindly, and instead develop their own independent thinking and judgement.
