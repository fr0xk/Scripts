# The DCF Delusion: Why Most Retail Investors Are Fooling Themselves With Flawed Valuations


I hope you are all doing well and enjoying the market euphoria. I have been lurking on this subreddit for a while and I have noticed a disturbing trend: many of you are acting smart with discounted cash flow (DCF) models.

You know what I mean. You plug in some optimistic assumptions about growth rates, margins, discount rates, terminal values, etc. and voila, you get a nice valuation for your favorite stock. You then use this valuation to justify buying more shares or holding on to your existing ones.

But let me tell you something: DCF is not a magic wand that can turn any stock into a bargain. It is a tool that requires a lot of skill, judgment and humility to use properly. And most of you are not using it properly.

You are making two big mistakes: one, you are overestimating the future cash flows of the company; and two, you are underestimating the uncertainty and risk involved in those cash flows.

Let me explain.

- First, you are overestimating the future cash flows of the company. You are assuming that the company will grow at a high rate for a long time, that it will maintain or improve its margins, that it will face no competition or disruption, that it will have no capital expenditures or working capital needs, that it will pay no taxes or dividends, etc.

- But these assumptions are unrealistic and often contradicted by historical evidence. Most companies do not grow at a high rate for a long time. Most companies face competition and disruption. Most companies have capital expenditures and working capital needs. Most companies pay taxes and dividends.

- You are ignoring the fact that growth is hard to sustain and comes at a cost. You are ignoring the fact that margins tend to revert to the mean over time. You are ignoring the fact that the market is dynamic and unpredictable.

-'You are falling prey to what John Hussman calls the "Iron Law of Valuation": the higher the growth rate you assume, the lower the valuation multiple you should apply. And vice versa.

- You are also falling prey to what Charlie Munger calls the "Lollapalooza Effect": the tendency for multiple cognitive biases to reinforce each other and create extreme outcomes. In this case, you are suffering from confirmation bias, overconfidence bias, anchoring bias, availability bias, optimism bias, etc.

-'You are only looking for information that supports your bullish thesis. You are overestimating your own ability to forecast the future. You are sticking to your initial valuation even when new information emerges. You are focusing on the most recent and salient examples of success. You are expecting the best case scenario to happen.

- Second, you are underestimating the uncertainty and risk involved in those cash flows. You are assuming that the future will be smooth and stable, that there will be no surprises or shocks, that there will be no changes in consumer preferences or technology or regulations or geopolitics or anything else that could affect the business.

-'But these assumptions are also unrealistic and often contradicted by historical evidence. The future is not smooth and stable. The future is full of surprises and shocks. The future is full of changes in consumer preferences and technology and regulations and geopolitics and everything else that could affect the business.

-:You are ignoring the fact that uncertainty is inherent in any projection of future cash flows. You are ignoring the fact that risk is not only measured by volatility or beta, but also by exposure to rare and extreme events.

You are using a single point estimate for your valuation instead of a range or a distribution. You are using a constant discount rate instead of a variable one that reflects changing market conditions. You are using a terminal value that assumes perpetual growth instead of a finite horizon or an exit multiple.

- You are violating what Nassim Taleb calls the "Black Swan Principle": the idea that rare and extreme events have a disproportionate impact on history and markets. And you are violating what Benoit Mandelbrot calls the "Fractal Nature of Markets": the idea that markets exhibit patterns of variability across different scales of time and space.

- You are also violating what Daniel Kahneman calls the "Planning Fallacy": the tendency to underestimate the time, costs and risks involved in a project. And you are violating what Philip Tetlock calls the "Hedgehog Syndrome": the tendency to have a single big idea that explains everything and to be overconfident in its accuracy.

- You are not accounting for the possibility of delays, setbacks, failures, lawsuits, scandals, frauds, bankruptcies, wars, pandemics, etc. You are not accounting for the possibility of new entrants, substitutes, disruptors, innovators, regulators, activists, etc.

## TL;DR: DCF is a complex and subjective tool that requires a lot of skill, judgment and humility to use properly. Most retail investors are using it improperly by making unrealistic and optimistic assumptions about future cash flows and ignoring the uncertainty and risk involved. This leads to inflated and inaccurate valuations that can result in poor investment decisions and losses.
