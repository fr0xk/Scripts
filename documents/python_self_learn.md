   - Learn about libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, and practice manipulating and visualizing data.

### Tips for Effortless Learning

- Keep your notes and code organized and neat. Use different colored pens or markers to make your notes more visually appealing and easier to read.

- Use spaced repetition to reinforce concepts and vocabulary. Review your notes and programs regularly, and try to recall key concepts without looking at your notes.

- Practice writing code by hand before typing it into a computer. This will help you catch syntax errors and think more deeply about program logic.

- Use real-world examples and problems to motivate your learning. Think of ways to apply what you're learning to your personal or professional life, and work on projects that interest you
