Hey there!

Just wanted to share some information about low-wage income and spending patterns in India. The minimum wage for unskilled

labor is currently Rs. 176 per day, but many workers earn less than this. According to the International Labour

Organization (ILO), the average monthly wage for informal workers in India is around Rs. 7,000, while the average monthly

wage for formal workers is around Rs. 17,000.

If you or someone you know is a low-wage earner, it's important to prioritize spending on basic necessities such as food,

housing, and healthcare. For a person with a BMI of 15 or below, it's especially important to focus on nutrient-dense foods

to promote weight gain.

Here's a breakdown of how a low-wage underweight person could allocate their spending, by percentage:

1. Food and Beverages: 60-70%

2. Healthcare: 10-15%

3. Clothing and Footwear: 5-10%

4. Housing and Utilities: 10-15%

5. Personal and Miscellaneous: 5-10%

6. Transport and Communication: 5-10%

Remember, these percentages are just a guideline and may vary based on individual circumstances. If you need help finding
